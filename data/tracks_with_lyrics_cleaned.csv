HUMBLE.,Kendrick Lamar,46574,"Nobody pray for me
It been that day for me
Way (Yeah, yeah)

Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin’ this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact, I'm downin' this
D’ussé with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down, we playin' Tetris
A.m. to the p.m., p.m. to the a.m., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks

I know you want this for life,
Taking pictures with all my ice
But I can't have no, no wife,
I just want you for the night,
:
Aye, lil mama would you like to be my sunshine?
Nigga touch my gang,
We gon' turn this into columbine
Ice on my neck cost me 10 times 3
Thirty thousand dollars for a nigga to get flee
I just hit the rodeo and spent like 10 G's
I just did a show, spent a cheque on my mama
When I go on vacay, I might rent out the Bahamas
And I keep like 10 phones,
Damn, I'm really never home,
:
Pulled up on your chick, tell your man I'm sorry
Hundred on my wrist jumping out the 'Rari
Ooh, she hit the splits, she know how to party
When I'm with my clique she know how to party

Sorry!

Bounce Back,Big Sean,33699,"Hitmaka
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you, God, God bless you, thank you so much)

Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back

D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen courtrooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

No Role Modelz,J. Cole,32336,"First things first: rest in peace, Uncle Phil
For real
You the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville
Fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville, talk to a nigga

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

No role models, and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night, I was gettin' my feet rubbed by the baddest bitch
Not Trina, but I swear to God, this bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, ""Hey, what's good?
Sorry, I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good""
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in White neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, ""Nah, I was the same without it""
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
'Fore I started callin' bitches ""bitches"" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody, you wadn't sweatin' me

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

I want a real love, dark-skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do', nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt 'fore she leave
""I'ma need my shirt back"" (Nigga, you know how it go)

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once... shame on... shame on you
Fool me—can't get fooled again

Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)
Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)

My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch prolly couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song

Fuck wrong with you? What you was thinkin'?

You talk that talk that make a lame ass nigga fall in love

And gettin' chased by their baby mommas

Sacrificin' everything, I feel like Jesus Carter
Hold up, I got this sewed up, my soda poured up
My woes up, I'm flippin' those bucks, they doing toe tucks
I rolled up and let the smoke puff
I lay down, told yah
Hold up, get too choked up when I think of old stuff
Move on, put my goons on, they kidnap newborns
In the streets my face a coupon
Her pussy too warm
All these bitches come to do harm
Just bought a new charm
Fuck the watch, I buy a new arm, you lukewarm
I'm Uncle Luke with the hoes
Pretty bitches, centerfolds
Tippy toes around my crib in their robes, just their robes
Half a milli' in the safe, another in the pillowcase

Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said, ""I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm""
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard, she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case

i wanna feel alive, i don't even wanna die anymore

Thinking Out Loud,Ed Sheeran,25110,"When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three

And I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory

I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan

I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

Okay
Hold up, wait a minute (Minute)
All good just a week ago
Crew at my house
And we party every weekend, so
On the radio
That's my favorite song
Make me bounce around like I don't know
Like I won't be here long
Now, the thrill is gone
Got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor (No)
Girl, why is you lyin'? (What?)
Girl, why you Mufasa?
Yeah, mi casa su casa
Gotta strip it like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes
Now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva
IPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra
Or we let bygones be bygones
""My God, you pay for your friends?"" (What?)
I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies
Why I feel so the opposite?

On whether or not it's worth it
So insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame
We blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine
Or leave it like Cobain
And when I'm long gone
Whole crew sing a swan song

Got a Lambo like LeBron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go (Yeah)
Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo (Yeah)

Can't tell

Ooh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
'Cause I got me for life (
Yeah

Ooh, I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul (
Ah
)

And as far as I can see, I just need privacy
Plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty
I just need space to do me, give the world what they're tryna see
A Stella Maxwell right beside of me
A Ferrari, I'm buyin' three
A closet of Saint Laurent, get what I want when I want
'Cause this hunger is drivin' me, yeah
I just need to be alone, I just need to be at home
Understand what I'm speakin' on, if time is money I need a loan
But regardless I'll always keep keepin' on
Fuck fake friends, we don't take L's, we just make M's

And it gets me every time (Yeah)

And I don't like talkin' to strangers
So get the fuck off me, I'm anxious
I'm tryna be cool, but I may just go apeshit
Say ""Fuck y'all!"" to all of y'all faces
It changes though, now that I'm famous
Everyone knows how this lifestyle is dangerous
But I love it, the rush is amazin'
Celebrate nightly and everyone rages
I found how to cope with my angers
I'm swimmin' in money
Swimmin' in liquor, my liver is muddy
But it's all good, I'm still sippin' this bubbly
This shit is lovely
This shit ain't random, I didn't get lucky
Made it right here 'cause I'm sick with it, cuddy

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door

Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had

All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me

How ya fi give the woman access to your villa?
Trespasser and a witness, all the hacklin' a yuh pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killa
Best review the situation that you caught up inna
To be a true player, you haffi know how fi play
If she say, ""A night,"" convince her, say, ""A day""
Never admit to a word weh she say
And if she claim a yuh, tell her, ""Baby, no way!""

Stressed Out,Twenty One Pilots,23050,"I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam

What a shame
If you were mine, you would not get the same
If you were mine, you would top everything
Suicide in the drop switchin' lanes
And that thing so fire, baby, no propane
Got good pussy, girl, can I be frank?
To keep it 100, girl, I ain't no saint

Body Like A Back Road,Sam Hunt,22506,"Got a girl from the Southside, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell up out my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet, man
And ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

We're out here in the boondocks with the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass with my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven, headed south of her smile, mmm
Get there when we get there, every inch is a mile

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed

Say You Won't Let Go,James Arthur,22445,"I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""

I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I'll forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, woah
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day, you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you, and I hope you know
Darlin', your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear, look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till my lungs give out
I promise till death we part, like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
That it's just you and me till we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go","i met you in the dark, you lit me up

Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask, 'cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
'Cause right now, thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit

If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear, ""Yawk, yawk, yawk, yawk""

Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga

Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window — check yourself
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat, the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where **** hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, ""Ayy, y'all, duck""
That's what mama said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess

Wake yo' punk-ass up
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin', nigga?)
Hood ('Sup, cuz?)
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do

Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the livin' room of my mama's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed (Watch out, cuz)
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery, the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up (Sup?)
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons, but still'll never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. ""Compton's Human Sacrifice""

G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton

I'm still in the hood, loc, g-yeah, that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But, g-yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left, so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, g-yeah
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, g-yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause, g-yeah, it's so real, g-yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand

If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
Made me an Angel on Angel Dust, what?

Brown Eyed Girl,Van Morrison,20080,"Hey, where did we go?
Days when the rains came
Down in the hollow
Playin' a new game
Laughin' and a-runnin', hey, hey
Skippin' and a jumpin'
In the misty morning fog with
Our, our hearts a thumpin'

And you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow?
Going down the old mine
With a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and sliding
All along the waterfall
With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-tee-da?
Just like that
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-tee-da
La-tee-da

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinking about
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium
With you, my brown-eyed girl

Take Me To Church,Hozier,19918,"My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's gettin' more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick, you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

A, amen
Amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea, get somethin' shiny
Somethin' meaty for the main course
That's a fine lookin' high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starvin' faithful
That looks tasty, that looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then, I am human, only then, I am clean

Oh, oh, amen
Amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

i was born sick, but i love it
command me to be well
a, amen
amen, amen
take me to church
i'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
i'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that deathless death
oh, good god, let me give you my life
take me to church
i'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
i'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that deathless death
oh, good god, let me give you my life
if i'm a pagan of the good times
my lover's the sunlight
to keep the goddess on my side
she demands a sacrifice
drain the whole sea, get somethin' shiny
somethin' meaty for the main course
that's a fine lookin' high horse
what you got in the stable?
we've a lot of starvin' faithful
that looks tasty, that looks plenty
this is hungry work
take me to church
i'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
i'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
offer me my deathless death
oh, good god, let me give you my life
take me to church
i'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
i'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
offer me my deathless death
oh, good god, let me give you my life
no masters or kings when the ritual begins
there is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
in the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
only then, i am human, only then, i am clean
oh, oh, amen
amen, amen
take me to church
i'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
i'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that deathless death
oh, good god, let me give you my life

Yeah
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well
Wadn't nuttin' like that
Man, it wadn't nuttin' like that

First time, she was in my math class (Uh-huh)
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad, so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it, uh
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school, ‘cause when I seen
Them thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up, as time goes by
Attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin', I want it bad
And I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, ""You ever had sex before?"" Damn…

And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

I wrote back and said
""Of course I had sex before,"" knowin' I was frontin'
I said, ""I'm like a pro, baby,"" knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one, but
She don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
""Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'.""
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please, don't make me stand up, I wrote back like
""Yeah, baby, sound like a plan.""
Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin, fuck

And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

Yeah, you know that feelin' when you
Know you finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck wit'
And most of all I'm prayin', ""God, don't let me bust quick""
I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on—how it go? Right
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palm sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin' and her face start blushin'
And a nigga roll over on top and then she
Get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbin'
On me, ooh girl, don't stop, it's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said
""I wanna get somethin' off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause—""
‘Cause I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

Singing from heartache from the pain, taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain, seeing the beauty through the

Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Falling like ashes to the ground, hoping my feelings, they would drown

Sweet Child O' Mine,Guns N' Roses,19550,"She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then, when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry

Woah, oh, oh
Sweet child of mine
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine


She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where, as a child, I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

That's why I kissed you

7 Years,Lukas Graham,18735,"Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was seven years old

It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learnin' quicker
By eleven, smokin' herb and drinkin' burnin' liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writin' songs, I started writin' stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the mornin' sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was twenty years old (Lukas Graham!)

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writin' 'bout everything I saw before me
Once, I was twenty years old

Soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roamin'
Soon, we'll be thirty years old

I'm still learnin' about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seekin' glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry

Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month

Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old

And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn
To win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Mm, mm

Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find
Love, love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our godforsaken right to be
Loved, loved, loved, loved, loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm sure
There's no need to complicate, our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

Do you want to come on
Scootch on over closer, dear

Woah, oh-oh

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well, open up your mind and see like me (I won't hesitate)
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free (No more, no more)
Look into your heart and you'll find that (It cannot wait)
The sky is yours (I'm sure)
So please don't, please don't, please don't (No need to complicate)
There's no need to complicate (Our time is short)

Last month, I helped her with the car payment
Young and we alive,

We never gonna die,

I just copped a jet to fly over personal debt
Put one up in the sky
The sun is in my eyes,

Let Her Go,Passenger,18321,"Well, you only need the light when it's burning low

'Till I Collapse,Eminem,18298,"(
Yo, left, yo, left
) 'Cause sometimes you just feel tired
(
Yo, left, right, left
) Feel weak, and when you feel weak
(
Yo, left, yo, left
) You feel like you wanna just give up
(
Yo, left, right, left
) But you gotta search within you
(
Yo, left, yo, left
) Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
(
Yo, left, right, left
) And get that motivation to not give up
(
Yo, left, yo, left
) And not be a quitter
(
Yo, left, right, left
) No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse

'Til I collapse, I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop, you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out ('Til the roof, until the roof)
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth (The roof comes off, the roof comes off)
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps ('Til my legs, until my legs)
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me)

Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it, 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, JAY-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, this shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney—Nate, hit me

I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me)

Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so

Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still

Holdin' me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

Lovin' can mend your soul

Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Next to your heartbeat, where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?
I got a 150,000 dollars for an afterparty
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down
But if you bring me up, then they might take you down
Fake fucked with me back then

It's Cardi, ayy
Said I'm the shit, they can't fuck with me if they wanted to
I don't gotta dance

Said, ""Lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to""
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves (Ayy, ayy)
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months
What bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, ""Goals,"" bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE
I might just chill with your boo, I might just feel on your babe
My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, ""Okay""
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front (Vroom, vroom)
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill

If you a pussy, you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil' bitch play her role
I just arrove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott

Sweater Weather,The Neighbourhood,17576,"And all I am is a man

Touch my neck and I'll touch yours

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love the taste, yeah

Only,Nicki Minaj,17465,"Yo, I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life, man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd ménage with 'em
And let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate
I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a setup
For a punchline on duct tape
Wo-wo-wo-worried 'bout if my butt fake
Wo-worried 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
Th-These girls are my sons
Jo-Jon & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight
I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5
Is my idea of a update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two
Big titties, big butt too
Fu-Fuck with them real niggas
Who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is
Ri-Ring finger where the rock is
The-These hoes couldn't test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with
Ma-Ma-Mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens
Unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in
Like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me
Lance Stephenson
[Chorus: Chris Brown & 
Drake

Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothin' but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothin' but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side (
Yeah
), only

I never fucked Nicki 'cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought, ""Goddamn, this is the perfect time""
We had just come from that video
You know, L.A. traffic, how the city slow
She was sittin' down on that big butt
But I was still starin' at the titties though
Yeah, low-key or maybe high-key
I been peeped that you like me, you know?
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW
Yeah, type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston, Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh! Yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doin' makeup and hair fuck with you, oh
That's 'cause I believe in somethin', I stand for it
And Nicki, if you ever tryna fuck
Just give me the heads-up, so I can plan for it

If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
'Cause she act like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story-teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she wave
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, masked up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga
I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the ""B"" off behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean ""pop-pop-pop,"" then I take off
Nigga, now you see me, nigga, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx actin' like Ray Charles
Sixteen in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with seventeen bullets
My story is how I went from ""poor me""
To ""please pour me a drink and celebrate with me""

Drops of Jupiter,Train,17452,"Now, that she's back in the atmosphere

Who was too afraid to fly, so he never did land

Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?

Nope
Didn't think so

How you doin', young lady?
That feelin' that you're givin' really drives me crazy
You're dope, have a player 'bout to choke
I was at a loss for words first time that we spoke
You lookin' for a girl that'll treat you right?
You lookin' for her in the daytime with the light?
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night
You expect me to just let you hit it?
But will you still respect me if you get it?
All I can do is try, gimme one chance (Chance)
What's the problem? I don't see the ring on your hand (Hand)
I'll be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent
You wanna get in my world, get lost in it?
Boy, I'm tired of runnin', let's walk for a minute

Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want

That I'm all yours, what you waitin' for?
Promiscuous girl, you're teasin' me
You know what I want, and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point
'Cause we're on a roll, you ready?

Roses are red, some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead, but you're still kinda cute
Hey, I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at? Do you mind if I come through?
I'm out of this world, come with me to my planet
Get you on my level, do you think that you can handle it?
They call me Thomas, last name Crown
Recognize game, I'ma lay mine's down
I'm a big girl, I can handle myself
But if I get lonely, I'ma need your help
Pay attention to me, I don't talk for my health
I want you on my team (So does everybody else)

Let your guard down, ain't nobody gotta know

I can see you with nothin' on
Feelin' on me before you bring that on
Bring that on? You know what I mean
Girl, I'm a freak, you shouldn't say those things
I'm only tryna get inside of your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say
It's okay, it's all right
I got somethin' that you gon' like

Piano Man,Billy Joel,17245,"It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sittin' next to me
Makin' love to his tonic and gin
He says, ""Son, can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad, and it's sweet, and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes""

La-la, di-dee-da da-dum

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright

Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke, or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
He says, ""Bill, I believe this is killing me""
As the smile ran away from his face
""Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place""

Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the navy
And probably will be for life
And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone

'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar

Die A Happy Man,Thomas Rhett,16838,"Baby, last night was hands down

Muggzy On The Beat Hoe

Whistling dixie
Bitches all around, while I’m sipping on whiskey
Middle school thuggin’, had a bitch on the slide
Be your best friend, to get your sister aside
Her boyfriend’s gone, seen him leaving in the cab
Comes to me crying’,‘bout the reason that his mad
Pretend to listen for an hour, then we leaving to the pad
Roll that ass over, then I eat it from the back
VIP up in your party, with the baddest here
Bring ‘em back, acting like I’m cavalier
On my bed, setting up my camera gear
I don’t have light bulb moments, I have chandeliers
Getting high to fuck, bitches are kinky
G’s on repeat, like when I listen to Fifty
“Thats my girl!”, said I’m bringing her with me
She’ll be back in morning, breath stinking of whiskey
When these sluts around me, they know how to act
Occasionally I rap, so getting x’s in our chats
Your bea up on my lap, when she naked in my pad
She making that shit clap, when she take it from the back
Never judge a girl, by her profile pic
Just fishing for those likes, when they shows those tits
Filters all over, that photo clicked
Up in real life, you wouldn’t even know that bitch
Before I get a girl, living all my fantasies
First double check she looks the same up in reality
Thats the difference bruh, between you and I
You never come correct, I always do it right
Kissing on your girl, fuck the bro code bitch
Saying that I won’t, while she blows my dick
Shows her best parts first, like a promo clip
Fighting over bitches, is some homo shit
‘ish know my stance, won’t hold your hand
We won’t slow dance, theres no romance
Go back to ex man, go head fam
You been used & stretched out, like an old headband

but we could be together if you wanted to
 do i wanna know? if this feelin' flows both ways?
 sad to see you go was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
 baby, we both know that the nights were mainly made
for sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
crawlin' back to you crawlin' back to you 
ever thought of callin' when
you've had a few? you've had a few 
'cause i always do 'cause i always do 
maybe i'm too maybe i'm too busy 
busy bein' yours bein' yours

Wake Me Up - Radio Edit,Avicii,16485,"Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is the prize

I got enemies, got a lot of enemies
Got a lot of people tryna drain me of my energy
They tryna take the wave from a nigga
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga

I got girls in real life tryna fuck up my day
Fuck goin' online, that ain't part of my day
I got real shit poppin' with my family too
I got niggas that can never leave Canada too (

I got bitches askin' me about the code for the Wi-Fi
So they can talk about they Timeline
And show me pictures of they friends
Just to tell me they ain't really friends
Ex-girl, she the female version of me
I got strippers in my life, but they virgins to me
I hear everybody talkin' 'bout what they gon' be
I got high hopes for you niggas, we gon' see
I got money in the courts 'til all my niggas are free
'Bout to call your ass a Uber, I got somewhere to be
I hear fairy tales 'bout how they gon' run up on me
Well, run up when you see me, then, and we gon' see

I got enemies, got a lot of enemies
Got a lot of people tryna drain me of this energy

Mike WiLL Made-It (Hey, hey, hey)

I've done it before, I've seen it before
Tears splashin' the floor when I open the door for her
She actin' like a whore and I'ma let her
Learned from Project Pat-ta, pimpin', got a master's

Toss the money in the air, girl
Watch how your dreams hit the floor, uh
Wait 'til I get the buzz off this drug
Damn, girl, you way too fine for a local club
Killin' someone's vibe should be a fuckin' crime
Wastin' someone's time should be a fuckin' crime

How to Save a Life,The Fray,16316,"Step one, you say, ""We need to talk""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down, it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
Pray to God He hears you
And pray to God He hears you, and

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Forever,Drake,16276,"It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' 'ery girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, a—

Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like a album
Who'da thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list

Ayy, ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you could call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they gon' build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
'Member she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act

I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer

Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, woah
He can make them look like bozos, he's wonderin' if he should spit this slow
Fuck no, go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes and establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains who stand inside of the booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flyin' up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback, motherfucker, for the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouths with a bass so loud that it shakes the place

Demons,Imagine Dragons,16089,"When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth

Got treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity, and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece

Thinking no one man should have all that power

Really Really,Kevin Gates,15926,"Diamonds really diamonds
And I'm shining bright 'cause I'm really grindin'

Make 'em believe, I made 'em believe
A lyrical song writer and he can sing
Bringing in money like raking in leaves
I was just trying to get paper to sneeze
Achoo, that was a blessing
She special to you, I don't look at her special
Actually, I treat her regular
Not being seen, we not making no spectacle
Gates had her first then he gave her to Kevin
All the above, we do all the et cetera
Scared of the feds, had to switch up my cellular
He talking reckless, don't call me back ever
Passing through Gardere to holler at Glover
Shout out to Black, shout out to Cedric
Grey Monte Carlo, cocaine 911
Just hollered at Trav, I'm like the Reverend
My section ridiculous, watch where you steppin'
Pockets on indigent, can't be too careful
Steve like 'em tall and when they yellow
Broke and in college, fresh with low mileage
I like 'em black, pretty white teeth
Body unique, booty on fleek
Jhené Aiko, chewing her cheeks
Groceries, please, you know that was me

Keep it strong in case anyone testing us
Right or wrong, if it's this, you don't mess with it
When yo' bitch over here I don't mess with her
No detective work, I don't be questioning
Where she been, trying to read all of her messages
I don't speak on no man, that's irregular
Take her phone, disconnectin' her cellular
What you need that for undressin' her?
What you need that for caressin' her?
Spreading her legs 'bout to pleasure her
Pulling her hair from the back, go to pressin' her
Trying to see who tap first, made a bet with her
Relationship flaking, no eczema
She catching feelings, she say we inseparable
Oyster Perpetual, it's not a replica
Mustang GT in the streets, smoking vegetables
Trunk in the front, do it make me a elephant?
I really really put syrup in my beverages
Shopping in Beverly, check out my etiquette
Loving my swag, women tailor keep checking it

Africa,Toto,15660,"I hear the drums echoin' tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's comin' in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hopin' to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
""Hurry, boy, it's waitin' there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothin' that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
Ooh, ooh

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothin' that a hundred men or more could ever do

All My Friends,Snakehips,15652,"Uh-huh, hoo

We open with the vultures, kissing the cannibals
Sure, I get lonely, when I'm the only
Only human in the heaving heat of the animals

It will beat, it will burn, burn
Burn your love into the ground with the lips of another
Do you get lonely? Sure, I get lonely sometimes

Man, I drink too much
Another Friday night I've wasted
My eyes are black and red

Took the car (IGH!)

Chicken Fried,Zac Brown Band,15618,"You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And that's home, you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house, it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground

And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

It's funny how it's the little things in life
That mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive
Or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind
This I've come to know
So if you agree, have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast

To a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives
So we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love

Like our chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
Get your little chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've done seen the sun rise

Halo,Beyoncé,15601,"Remember those walls I built?

Little Talks,Of Monsters and Men,15587,"(Hey)
(Hey)
(Hey)

I don't like walking around this old and empty house
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you, my dear
The stairs creak as you sleep, it's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
And some days, I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way
'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

(Hey)
(Hey)
(Hey)

There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young
And full of life and full of love
Some days, I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear
'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

(Hey) Don't listen to a word I say
(Hey) The screams all sound the same
(Hey) Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

(Hey)
(Hey)

You're gone, gone, gone away, I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
Now wait, wait, wait for me, please hang around
I'll see you when I fall asleep

(Hey) The screams all sound the same
(Hey) Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore","i don't like walking around this old and empty house
so hold my hand, i'll walk with you, my dear
the stairs creak as you sleep, it's keeping me awake
it's the house telling you to close your eyes
and some days, i can't even dress myself
it's killing me to see you this way
'cause though the truth may vary
this ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
there's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
well, tell her that i miss our little talks
soon it will be over and buried with our past
we used to play outside when we were young
and full of life and full of love
some days, i don't know if i am wrong or right
your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear
'cause though the truth may vary
this ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
don't listen to a word i say
the screams all sound the same

Fuck all that ""Drake, you gotta chill"" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bills shit
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season
 in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker, that's my nigga
Oh, Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean, we could really get it, we could go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it (Arf!)
I run this shit, they like, ""Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest""
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh, Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't made me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I been ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man, I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help

The other night Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough, I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended, but they smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only twenty-seven and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

we're gonna have a house party
throw a neon t shirt over the lamp shade
i'll take the furniture, slide it out of the way
shakin' the floor, rattlin' the roof
we'll go to town right there in your living room
let's have a house party, we don't need nobody
turn your tv off, break that boombox out
we'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
and the cops will show up and try to shut us down
if you're gonna be a homebody
we're gonna have a house party
if you wanna be a homebody
we're gonna have a house party
so i'll be at your door in ten minutes
whatever you got on, baby, stay in it
you ain't gotta leave the house to have a good time
i'ma bring the good time home to you
we'll have a house party, we don't need nobody
turn your tv off, break that boombox out
we'll wake up all the neighbors 'til the whole block hates us
and the cops will show up and try to shut us down
if you're gonna be a homebody
we're gonna have a house party
if you wanna be a homebody
we're gonna have a house party"

""And, yes, but what a shame, what a shame the poor groom's bride is a whore""

Six-six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

Ahem
Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia, and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy 'cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doin' this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Tuna Fish, ha!

Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch (Yeah)
Six-six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch (I'm goin' back in)

Okay
I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these ma'fuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money... uh
Paper chasin', tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep, so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag, you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

Yeah, word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I-I play the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you niggas the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', amount I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler, Wayne
These niggas out they mind, I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind, tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love, keep throwin' my sign
In the middle, hit 'em up, piece on my side, ‘cause ain't no peace on my side

Sunday Candy,Donnie Trumpet & The Social Experiment,15298,"She can say in her voice, in her way that she love me
With her eyes, with her smile, with her belt, with her hands, with her money
I am the thesis of her prayers
Her nieces and her nephews are just pieces of the layers
Only ones she love as much as me is Jesus Christ and Taylor
I got a future, so I'm singing for my grandma
You singing too, but your grandma ain't my grandma
Mine's is handmade, pan-fried, sun-dried, southside

I come to church for the candy, your peppermints is the truth
I'm pessimistic on Monday if I had tweaked and missed you
You look so good with that hat on, had to match with the shoes
Came and dressed in the satin, I came and sat in your pew
I come to Christmas for dinner, fifty rolls on my plate
Hella holes in my stocking holding your pockets in place
I like my love with a budget, I like my hugs with a scent
You smell like light, gas, water, electricity, rent
You sound like, ""Why the gospel choir got so tired?""
Singin' his praises daily basis, so I gotta try it
You're my dreamcatcher, dream team, team captain
Matter fact, I ain't seen you in a minute
Let me take my butt to church

I am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me, Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes, I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music, I would share it, but, today, I'm yellin'
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibeBitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe

Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the colorblind is hangin' witcha?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar, another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick, I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every makin' of his? Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge, even a small lighter can burn a bridge

I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people 'round me just wanna be famous
You can see that my city found me, then put me on stages
To me, that's amazin'
To you, that's a quick check, with all disrespect, let me say this

You're tryna keep it deprived and only cosign what radio does

You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you're scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to, this shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain is way more believable
Give me a feasible gain, rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know
This is somethin' you can blame on yourself, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock, I'ma break out and then hide every lock

But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

Despite her past, she can't help the attraction
He tells her that he's nothing like the last one
He redefines in every way what love is
She fell for him and hasn't gotten up since
Every now and then, she goes off, though
Beating on his chest like a bongo
He understands she's coming from a hurt place
Answers all the questions on her survey
Doesn't get jealous, doesn't break trust
Doesn't call her, ""Ho"" after hang-ups
Give her everything she ever wanted
And even though she still feels haunted

I've been getting dirty money; Jordan Belfort
Stacking penny stocks while I'm flipping these birds
Sipping on Ciroc, trip 'em up with the words
I just popped a molly and I think this be my third
Jordan Belfort, Jordan Belfort
I been getting dirty money; Jordan Belfort
Stacking penny stocks while I'm flipping these birds

I just flipped a birdy, money so dirty
Got my bitch a mink, furry like Furby
I came up, made a milly, spent it on a rollie
Stackin gouda, feta, chedda cheese and ravioli
Or maybe fettuccine, dirty martini
I'ma fuck your bitch,  call me Houdini
I'm drivin' Lamborghini, your ho in a bikini
Eight bottles to the neck, three wishes from a genie
Benjamin ain't dirty, but these Franklins be filthy
Always going to court, but I'm never pleadin' guilty
Ballin' so hard I only be slam dunkin’
Beat steady rock and the trunk straight thumpin'
I be ridin' foreign, pourin' merlot while I swerve
Pedal to the medal when I'm whippin' round the curb
And I'm rollin' up this marijuana, you can smell the herb
And I be getting all this lettuce, I ain't talkin' iceberg

LV loafers on my sofa in Bel-Air
Turnin' up daily cause we can't turn down at work
I been lightin' loud lately like my volume switch don't work
And my cologne is Versace, Medusa got me stoned
I'm always high on something, but I usually like to smoke
We been long time friends, me and Ben Frank
Every fucking day he needs a ride home from the bank
Muhfucka, you don't know me, you ain't in my tax section
My wallet ain't fat, it's in the gym straight flexing
I don't call your bitch back and she's checkin' her reception
Bitch with double D's, she's all up on my erection
And I'm in the ovaries, but I ain't about affection
So easily the sober me just smokes and then forgets them
Sometimes this life seems a little stressful
Especially when they tell me that I am something special

No Diggity,Blackstreet,15074,"Yeah
You know what?
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt, uh
Play on, playette
Play on, playette
Yo, Dre, drop the verse

It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me, collab' creations bump like acne
No doubt, I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch, a dog couldn't catch me **** out
Tell me who can stop when Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much grounds, got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind (Wow)
I think about the girl all the time (Wow-wow)
East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash, stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win?

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up)

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Get up)

She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild
Very low-key on the profile
Catchin' feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Herb's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers, it curves, so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You've got to pay to play
Just for shorty bang-bang to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride

I like the way you work it

'Cause that's my peeps and we rolls deep
Flyin' first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me? Not a **** thing
Cartier wooden frames sported by my shorty
As for me, icy gleaming pinkie diamond ring
We bes the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake-**** broads?
I shows and proves, no doubt, I been diggin' you so
Please excuse if I come across rude, that's just me
And that's how a playette's got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Ask the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking moves never been my thing
So, Teddy, pass the word to your **** Chauncy
I'll be sending the call, let's say, around 3:30

Seven Nation Army,The White Stripes,15029,"I'm gonna fight 'em off
A seven-nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Takin' their time right behind my back
And I'm talkin' to myself at night because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind, behind a cigarette
And the message comin' from my eyes says, ""Leave it alone""


Don't wanna hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell
And if I catch it comin' back my way, I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear, but that's what I'll do
And the feelin' comin' from my bones says, ""Find a home""


I'm goin' to Wichita
Far from this opera forevermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleedin' and I'm bleedin' and I'm bleedin' right before the Lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me and I will think no more
And the stains comin' from my blood tell me, ""Go back home""","i'm gonna fight 'em off
a seven nation army couldn't hold me back
they're gonna rip it off
takin' their time right behind my back
and i'm talkin' to myself at night because i can't forget
back and forth through my mind, behind a cigarette
and the message comin' from my eyes says, ""leave it alone""
don't wanna hear about it
every single one's got a story to tell
everyone knows about it
from the queen of england to the hounds of hell
and if i catch it comin' back my way, i'm gonna serve it to you
and that ain't what you want to hear, but that's what i'll do
and the feelin' comin' from my bones says, ""find a home""
i'm goin' to wichita
far from this opera forevermore
i'm gonna work the straw
make the sweat drip out of every pore
and i'm bleedin' and i'm bleedin' and i'm bleedin' right before the lord
all the words are gonna bleed from me and i will think no more
and the stains comin' from my blood tell me, ""go back home"""

And then I gotta get it again and again and then again
And I be doin' it to death
And now I move a little foul, a nigga better call a ref
And everybody know my style and niggas know that I'm the best
When it come to doin' this and I be bangin' on my chest

Gotta taste it and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic

And little girls from Sweden dream of silver-screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication

It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the East, at least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication

Space may be the final frontier, but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off

Look
I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
 (Uh-huh)
Straight up, look

I live the life I deserve, blessed
Fuck a vacay, I feel better at work
I mean, whatever it's worth, I'll give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me, I'ma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like, ""Father, forgive me, these are all my confessions""
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd n Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you ""dog,"" that shit get-get petty
Bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back is that it just keep comin' back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after 3
Man, this is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty
Man, the clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The fee not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Young prophet with profit, oh God

I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I

Way up, I feel blessed

Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothin'
‘Cause that implies that we're back from somethin'
If we're back from somethin', it's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys the business, man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6, look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doin' a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear y'all be doin' the most
Stop worryin' 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worryin' less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left that's still doin' this shit, man

I'm way up, I feel blessed (
Straight up, straight up

Way up, I feel blessed

My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up 'cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align, you do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million-dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never goin' anorexic
I pay my own mortgage and electric
Never goin' under, even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checkin' off my checklist
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together?

Way up, I feel blessed

Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God, I hope they post it, I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three POs like Star Wars
They want me by the road holdin' up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm callin' you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there gettin' homeschooled, I'm blessed
And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school, a Montessori
And the hallway lookin' like a monastery, oh, yes

Come and See Me (feat. Drake),PARTYNEXTDOOR,14815,"Doesn't make sense now
Shit just got real, things are gettin' intense now
I hear you talkin' 'bout ""We"" a lot, oh, you speak French now?
Giving me the signs so I gotta take a hint now
I hit you up like ""Do you wanna hang right now?""
On the East Side and you know I'm with the gang right now
You say do I own a watch, do I know what time it is right now
It's after 2 a.m. and that's askin' a lot of you right now

All she talkin' bout is, ""Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me""
All she ever say is, ""Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me""

I been up for two whole days thinkin' what I did to keep you goin'
Thumbin' through the voicemails that you left me tellin' me where I went wrong
I'll admit I'm sorry when I feel I'm truly sorry
Things change, people change, feelings change too
Never thought the circumstances woulda changed you
You said you never traded, no (Yeah, you said that)
And I believed you when they told me don't
(Yeah, I thought you meant that)
But either way you're still invited and I can't even lie to you

Swear these days all you say is, ""Come and see me for once

How hard is it to let you know when I'm comin' home?
That way you can be prepared

I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real

My baby a drama mama don't like me
She be doin' things like havin' them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She need to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills, I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story, we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real

I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real

You say it's puppy love, we say it's full-grown (Arroof)
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic but you can't predict the weather
Ms. Jackson

Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin', find
The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes, I will be present on the first day of school and graduation

Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out (Out)
Now you and your girl ain't speakin' no more 'cause my dick all in her mouth (Mouth)

Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating in the year 2G, they be the same thing

See me up in the club with fifty-'leven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sittin' low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
And every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how I'm lookin', babe

Boy, this all for you, just walk my way
Just tell me how it's lookin', babe
Just tell me how it's lookin', babe (How it's lookin', babe)
I do this all for you, baby, just take aim
And tell me how it's lookin', babe (How it's lookin', babe)
Tell me how it's lookin', babe, lookin', babe

Drop the bass, mane, the bass get lower
Radio say, ""Speed it up,"" I just go slower
High like treble, pumpin' on the mids
The man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why you think you keep my name rollin' off the tongue?
'Cause when he want a smash, I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker

Oh, baby, baby be sweatin' off my hair

Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe?
Le sexe, je veux dire: l'activité physique, le coït. Tu aimes ça ?
Tu ne t'intéresses pas au sexe ?
Les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe, mais c'est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent

Everything I do need a news crew's presence
Speedboat swerve, homie, watch out for the waves

So I just meditate at the home in Pompeii
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
Every time I'm in Vegas they screamin' like, ""He's Elvis""
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it
Shit is real, got me feelin' Israelian
Like Bar Refaeli, or Gisele—no, that's Brazilian

And I wind up feelin' down

On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls

King Kunta,Kendrick Lamar,14200,"I got a bone to pick

Sittin' in my throne again
Ayy, ayy, nigga, what's happenin'?
K-Dot back in the hood, nigga
I'm mad (
He mad
), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?

You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street

Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can
)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
What the fuck happened? (
Oh no

I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (
A two-man cell

Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires

You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""Compton!""
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', ""Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?""

More Than a Feeling,Boston,14139,"I looked out this morning and the sun was gone

And I begin dreaming (More than a feeling)

Fuck a little Louis, put it in a bitch pocket
Put a pic with me on the 'gram, now you popping

Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope
Jackie Chan moves got game in the choke
Gas rolling up in the blunt, Amoco
12 tryin' come in the spot to open up the dope
Burglar bar doors got a young nigga confident
Juugin' out the stove and we still bangin', honest
Blowing on the O, yo, we call that ho an onion

Where your ass was at when all they'd ask was ""What's the hold up?""
Where your ass was at when niggas first got the news?
Now your ass around because we're paying back dues
Where were you when all the dogs needed help?
Lawyers and the commissary ain't gon' pay itself
Where your ass was at when we recorded in the bathroom?
Where your ass was at? I take attendance like a classroom
Man I ain't got no choice
'Cause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy
I'm self-made, selfish with my women, self-employed
I'll buy the neighbor's house if they complain about the noise

Juke Jam (feat. Justin Bieber & Towkio),Chance The Rapper,14075,"We used to roll at the Rink, we used to roll at the Rink
I used to talk way too much, you used to know everything
You couldn't stand me, I couldn't stand you
You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too
Your big brother foot work
Your play sister Juke
The Rink was the place
But in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me, too worried 'bout Frooties and Chews
'Til I found out all the shawdy's with cooties was cute
And realized what booties can do

We gon' get it poppin'
We gon' get it Jukin'

Maybe you and I were meant to be

We never rolled at the Rink

You ain't buy tokens no more
You just hip roll at the Rink
You had a nigga, I couldn't stand him
But when they play ""Take You Down"", Chris Brown
I am his stand-in
I mean it's just dancing
It's harmless as fuck
Then I put my waist through your hips
And your legs and my arms just to harness you up
Then we hit the floor
All the kiddies stop skating
To see grown folks do, what grown folks do
When they grown and they dating

Maybe I'm crazy

There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more


Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion

Work Out,J. Cole,14007,"I want to see you work out for me, work out for me

Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then

Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

She like them boys with the big ol' chains
Ridin' around town in a big ol' Range
I knew her when I rocked big ol' jeans
Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: “Baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.”
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year
That's unfair, but so is life, take a chance, roll the dice
Money can’t buy you love, 'cause it’s overpriced
Don’t overthink, just hope it's right
I’m only here for the night

Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain

Any other day I would call, you would say
""Baby, how's your day?"" But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is ""Uh-huh, yeah, okay""
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there, first of all, let me say
I am not the one to sit around and be played
So prove yourself to me if I'm the girl that you claim
Why don't you say the things that you said to me yesterday?

I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's goin' down, that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be no reason why you're actin' strange

You & Me,Marc E. Bassy,13717,"Girl you party all the time
Don't let me stay on your mind
Adderall and cheap wine
Just to stay awake in conversation
We were always so damn insecure
So how could we ever know for sure
And disregard the way I know we feel
That would make this city way too real

If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more

Gems in my golden necklace
You didn't give me none of this
There's nothing for me to miss
We were too young on the day we met
How could we say we would not forget
And in the shadows there's a place for us
Somewhere hidden they can't find our love

Know I'm hard headed and I might of acted foolishly
But you the one to hold us down usually
We was in a limbo
But of all people you ain't have to fuck with him though
That was my homie I had gave y'all the intro
Some things fall apart and some get thrown out the window
Remember when we first met we might've been too young
But we was from The Bay so we both was going too dumb
I used to be the one for you now you got a new one
So till the next lifetime, maybe we can do some'n

Handing tickets out for God
Turning back, she just laughs

In the auditorium
Looking on, she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums

But, oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

Hold me closer, tiny dancer

You dig?
Yeah, Mack, I'm goin' in

A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair (Woo)
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
'Cause I don't write shit 'cause I ain't got time
'Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cho-cho-cho-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father, mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers, ""Ha-ha-ha-ha, you can't catch him, you can't stop him""
I go by them goon rules, if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em, you can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em 'cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

Motherfucker, I'm ill, yeah

Call me what you want, bitch, call me on my sidekick
Never answer when it's private, damn, I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to my bitch, haha

So when she ask for the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch (Woo)
And it ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass, you ain't got shit

Who that one that do that, boy? You knew that, chew that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels

But I would like for you to pay me by the hour, haha
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen, sharin' showers, huh
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower

Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker, I say, ""Life ain't shit without me""
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe, look like it's poutin'

Viva La Vida,Coldplay,13534,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the mornin', I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead, long live the king""
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
And revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (
Mmm, mmm

If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh, why must I feel this-a-way? (Hey, must be the money)

In the club on a late night, feeling right, lookin', tryna spot somethin' real nice
Looking for a little shawty I noticed, so that I can take her home (I can take her home)
She can be eighteen, eighteen with a attitude, or nineteen, kinda snotty, actin' real rude
Boo, as long as you a thicky, thicky, thick girl, you know that it's on (You know that it's on)
I peep somethin' coming towards me on the dance floor, sexy and real slow (Ayy)
Sayin' she be peepin' and, ""I dig the last video, somewhere, Nelly, can we go?""
How could I tell her no? Her measurements was 36-25-34 (Nelly)
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare

Without no vouchers on her boots, she's bringin' nothin' back
You should feel the impact, shoppin' with plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that four dot six Range
Watch the candy paint change every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now
Makin' a livin' off my brain instead of 'caine now
I got the title from my mama
Put the whip in my own name now
Damn, shit done changed now
Runnin' credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (C'mon), I can't complain now (No more)
Shit, I'm the man now, in and out my own town

Poppin' like we drug dealers, sippin' Crissy, bub', mackin'

Here,Alessia Cara,13332,"I guess right now you've got the last laugh

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really, I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So, you can go back, please, enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
I can hardly hear over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you, so tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly, I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan to take over the planet
So, pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
So, tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God, why am I here?

Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Hours later, congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here

and i know you mean only the best
and your intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly, i'd rather be
somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
some music with a message, like we usually do
and we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan to take over the planet
so, pardon my manners, i hope you'll understand that i'll be here
not there in the kitchen
with the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
so, tell them i'll be here
right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
oh god, why am i here?
oh oh oh, here, oh oh oh, here
oh oh oh, i ask myself, what am i doin' here?
oh oh oh, here, oh oh oh, here
and i can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
hours later, congregatin' next to the refrigerator
some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
how did it ever come to this? i should've never come to this
so holla at me, i'll be in the car when you're done
i'm stand offish, don't want what you're offerin'
and i'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
so tell my people when they're ready that i'm ready
and i'm standin' by the tv with my beanie low
yo, i'll be over here
oh oh oh, here, oh oh oh, here
oh oh oh, i ask myself, what am i doin' here?
oh oh oh, here, oh oh oh, here
and i can't wait till we can break up out of here"

What I Got,Sublime,13253,"I don't wanna fuck you, you can't even sing

Early in the mornin', risin' to the street
Light me up that cigarette and I'll strap shoes on my feet
Got to find the reason, reason things went wrong
Got to find the reason why my money's all gone
I got a dalmatian and I can still get high
I can play the guitar like a motherfuckin' riot

Well, life is (Too short), so love the one you got
'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot
Never start no static, I just get it off my chest
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest
Take a small example, take a ti-ti-ti-tip from me
Take all of your money, give it all to charity-ty-ty-ty
Love is what I got, it's within my reach
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach
It all comes back to you, you're bound to get what you deserve
Try and test that, you're bound to get served
Love's what I got, don't start a riot
You'll feel it when the dance gets hot

Lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
And remember that
Lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
(I got, I got, I got)

Why I don't cry when my dog runs away
I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay
I don't get angry when my mom smokes pot
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock
Fuckin' and fightin'; it's all the same
Living with Louie Dog's the only way to stay sane
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me

'Cause lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
And remember that
Lovin' is what I got
I said remember that
Lovin' is what I got

Better Together,Jack Johnson,13207,"There's no combination of words I could put on the back of a postcard
No song that I could sing but I can try for your heart

Like why are we here and where do we go, and how come it's so hard?
It's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving

Or brings new things, for tomorrow night, you see
That they'll be gone too, too many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find their way into my day to day scene
I'd be under the impression I was somewhere in between

Wagon Wheel,Darius Rucker,13192,"Heading down south to the land of the pines

Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights

And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

My baby plays the guitar, I pick a banjo now

But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more

But he's a headed west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun

It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock
With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop

The beach gives a feelin', an earthy feelin'
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you, I feel like I could die
And that would be alright, alright

And when the plane came in, she said she was crashin'
The velvet, it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
But now, I'm strugglin' to survive
Those days you were wearin' that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties, they pass the test
Slides up around the belly, face down on the mattress
One, and you hold me
And we are broken
Still, it's all that I want to do, just a little now
Feel myself, head made of the ground
I'm scared, I'm not comin' down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is alright, alright

And I want somethin' else

i believe in the sand beneath my toes
the beach gives a feelin', an earthy feelin'
i believe in the faith that grows
and the four right chords can make me cry
when i'm with you, i feel like i could die
and that would be alright, alright
and when the plane came in, she said she was crashin'
the velvet, it rips in the city
we tripped on the urge to feel alive
but now, i'm strugglin' to survive
those days you were wearin' that velvet dress
you're the priestess, i must confess
those little red panties, they pass the test
slides up around the belly, face down on the mattress
one, and you hold me
and we are broken
still, it's all that i want to do, just a little now
feel myself, head made of the ground
i'm scared, i'm not comin' down
no, no
and i won't run for my life
she's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
but nothing is alright, alright
and i want somethin' else
to get me through this life, baby
i want somethin' else
not listenin' when you say
goodbye
goodbye
goodbye
goodbye
doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo
the sky was gold, it was rose doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo 
i was takin' sips up into my nose doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo 
and i wish i could get back there, some place back there doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo 
in the place we used to start
doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo i want somethin' else"
Fast Car,Jonas Blue,13149,"Oh, woah, oh
Oh, oh

You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we will make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone

You see, my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say, his body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into

Get on top, then get to bounce around like a low rider

Had me thinkin' 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
Long as she ain't stoppin', homie, I ain't stoppin'
Drippin' wet with sweat, man, it's on and poppin'

Rap God,Eminem,13116,"""Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings""
""But I'm only going to get this one chance"" (
Six minutes—, six minutes—
)
""Something's wrong, I can feel it"" (
Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!
)
""Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances""
""You are just what the doc ordered""

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (
Kill 'em all with
)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce

'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got

Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of 
shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from 
The Mathers LP 1
 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (
J.J. Fad
)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?
Don't mistake him for 
Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?","""look, i was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings""
""but i'm only going to get this one chance"" 
six minutes , six minutes 
 
""something's wrong, i can feel it"" 
six minutes, slim shady, you're on!
 
""just a feeling i've got, like something's about to happen, but i don't know what.
if that means what i think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble 
and if he is as bananas as you say, i'm not taking any chances""
""you are just what the doc ordered""
i'm beginnin' to feel like a rap god, rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
they said i rap like a robot, so call me rap bot
but for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
i got a laptop in my back pocket
my pen'll go off when i half cock it
got a fat knot from that rap profit
made a livin' and a killin' off it
ever since bill clinton was still in office
with monica lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
i'm an mc still as honest
but as rude and as indecent as all hell
syllables, skill a holic 
kill 'em all with
 
this flippity dippity hippity hip hop
you don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
with this rappity brat, packin' a mac in the back of the ac'
backpack rap crap, yap yap, yackety yack
and at the exact same time, i attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while i'm practicin' that
i'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
only realized it was ironic, i was signed to aftermath after the fact
how could i not blow? all i do is drop f bombs
feel my wrath of attack
rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
it's actually disastrously bad for the wack
while i'm masterfully constructing this masterpi ce
'cause i'm beginnin' to feel like a rap god, rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like i have got
well, to be truthful the blueprint's
simply rage and youthful exuberance
everybody loves to root for a nuisance
hit the earth like an asteroid
did nothing but shoot for the moon since pew! 
mcs get taken to school with this music
'cause i use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
now i lead a new school full of students
me? i'm a product of rakim
lakim shabazz, 2pac, n.w.a, cube, hey doc, ren
yella, eazy, thank you, they got slim
inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
to meet run d.m.c., and induct them
into the motherfuckin' rock and roll hall of fame
even though i'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
only hall of fame i'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
on the wall of
shame
you fags think it's all a game, 'til i walk a flock of flames
off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
little gay lookin' boy
so gay i can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy ha ha! 
you're witnessin' a mass occur
like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""oy vey, that boy's gay!"" that's all they say, lookin' boy
you get a thumbs up, pat on the back
and a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
hey, lookin' boy! what you say, lookin' boy?
i get a ""hell yeah"" from dre, lookin' boy
i'ma work for everything i have, never asked nobody for shit
get outta my face, lookin' boy!
basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause 
i'm beginnin' to feel like a rap god, rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
the way i'm racin' around the track, call me nascar, nascar
dale earnhardt of the trailer park, the white trash god
kneel before general zod
this planet's krypton no, asgard, asgard
so you'll be thor and i'll be odin
you rodent, i'm omnipotent
let off, then i'm reloadin'
immediately with these bombs i'm totin'
and i should not be woken
i'm the walkin' dead, but i'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
but i got your mom deep throatin'
i'm out my ramen noodle
we have nothin' in common, poodle
i'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
it's me, my honesty's brutal
but it's honestly futile if i don't utilize what i do though
for good at least once in a while
so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes
to maybe try to help get some people through tough times
but i gotta keep a few punchlines
just in case 'cause even you unsigned
rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
i know there was a time where once i
was king of the underground
but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind
so i crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
appeal with the skin color of mine
you get too big and here they come tryin'
to censor you like that one line
i said on ""i'm back"" from
the mathers lp 1
when i
tried to say i'll take seven kids from columbine
put 'em all in a line, add an ak 47, a revolver and a 9
see if i get away with it now that i ain't as big as i was, but i'm
morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
you're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
and i don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
you're pointless as rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
you write normal? fuck being normal!
and i just bought a new raygun from the future
just to come and shoot ya, like when fabolous made ray j mad
'cause fab said he looked like a fag at mayweather's pad
singin' to a man while he played piano
man, oh man, that was a 24 7 special on the cable channel
so ray j went straight to the radio station
the very next day, ""hey fab, i'ma kill you!""

Cigarette Daydreams,Cage The Elephant,13047,"Did you stand there all alone?
Oh, I cannot explain what's going down

Power Trip,J. Cole,13043,"Got me up all night
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night
Constant drinkin' and love songs

Down-and-out with these love songs

Got me open all night, hey

Okay, back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song ""Dreams"" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home, I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I feel on you, I'm sayin'—

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya

And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)

Well, this has got to be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever and
Fuck it, I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, ""Give me twenty dollars, dollars!""
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliché
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: ""Please play!""
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but—

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me

I know my Houston partners, drop a four on this
And focus, and slow it down, down
(Woo, woo) Alright, let me blow this bitch
I'm famous, I blame this on you, cash in the mirror

Weed steady blowin', pass the blunt to my momma
Runs in the family, puff-puff keep a nigga fiendin'

Shot glass super size, she gon' get some dick tonight

American Pie,Don McLean,12996,"A long, long time ago
I can still remember how that music
Used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

So, bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Did you write the book of love?
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now, do you believe in rock 'n' roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died

I started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me
Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned
And while Lenin read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

We were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and fallin' fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
Now, the halftime air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance
'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

We started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So, come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the Devil's only friend
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

He was singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play
And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died

And there I stood alone and afraid
I dropped to my knees and there I prayed
And I promised Him everything I could give
If only He would make the music live
And He promised it would live once more
But this time one would equal four
And in five years four had come to mourn
And the music was reborn

And they were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

They were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die""","a long, long time ago
i can still remember how that music
used to make me smile
and i knew if i had my chance
that i could make those people dance
and maybe they'd be happy for a while
but february made me shiver
with every paper i'd deliver
bad news on the doorstep
i couldn't take one more step
i can't remember if i cried

Castle on the Hill,Ed Sheeran,12980,"When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was runnin' from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely gettin' by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill","when i was six years old, i broke my leg

we'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
but i can't wait to go home
i'm on my way
drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
singin' to ""tiny dancer""
and i miss the way you make me feel and it's real
we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
one friend left to sell clothes
one works down by the coast
one had two kids but lives alone
one's brother overdosed
one's already on his second wife
one's just barely gettin' by
but these people raised me
and i can't wait to go home
and i'm on my way, i still remember
these old country lanes
when we did not know the answers
and i miss the way you make me feel and it's real
we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill"

Cruise,Florida Georgia Line,12962,"Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Ayy, baby

Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, ""Oh, good lord,"" she had them long tanned legs
Couldn't help myself, so I walked up and said

Well, baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road, blowin' stop signs through the middle every little farm town with you
And this brand new Chevy with a lift kit would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it, heh
So, baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

Well, she was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker

When that summer sun fell to his knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
Because it felt so right, her and I, man, we felt so right

I put it in park and grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl, you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'
Hell, I can't get you out of my head

Play It Again,Luke Bryan,12880,"She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', ""no way, she ain't got one""
Soon as I sat down, I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""Come here, boy, I wanna dance""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""

I'da gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool; AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights, she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""

The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar

She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song

Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""

Fix You,Coldplay,12841,"When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse

And the tears come streamin' down your face
When you lose somethin' you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth

The Real Slim Shady,Eminem,12802,"May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam; like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh)
It's the return of the ""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said
Nothing, you idiots, Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha-ha)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka-chicka-chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who"", ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade they've got the 
Discovery Channel
, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals
Well, some of us cannibals who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him, and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win? Wouldn't it be weird?""
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo, shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady

I'm like a head trip to listen to
'Cause I'm only givin' you things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (Err), I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder, ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm goin', when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin'
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings (Ch, puh)
Or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be out of your mind and out of control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady

Pull up to the club and it go up
Make your girl fall in love when I show up
It's not my fault she want to know me
She told me you was just a homie
She came down like she knew me
Gave it up like a groupie
And that's facts, no printer
Cold boy turn the summer to the winter
She save me in her phone as bestie
But I had her screaming oooh
Yo girl wasn't supposed to text me
You want to know how I know what I know
Chorus

Got these girls in my section, finna blow up
Alan Z got them wet when I roll up
You can see it in their eyes and lips, their thighs and hips
When she pop it tell her hold up
Better believe she gone leave with a real singer
I dick her down can't put it down like I do
I get to bussin' no discussion, gotta deal with it
Team us we ain't worried about you
Murder she wrote
When I hit it I'ma kill it I'ma get it like
Murder she wrote
You want to know how I know what I know

I'm a magnet to anybody with ovaries
If she go toe to toe with me, she gon' see I'm a total freak
Totally, young dirty bastard reminiscent of ODB
Eat it like groceries, could give it to Jhene Aiko with ease
Like I’m 'post to be
Got fans making social media posts of me
Buzzing more than locally, from Atlanta to overseas
If you wanna roll with me, just Say Yes like Floetry
Get you off tonight, on and off the mic, banging over beats
DJ Xross:
Banging over beats, spitting rhymes and poetry
Senpai notice me, and she be all like OMG

Lay Me Down,Sam Smith,12664,"Yes, I do, I believe
That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're all right?
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call? (Who's to say you won't hear me?)

What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my mama I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reapin' everything I sow, so my karma comin' heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfuckin' gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I've gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say

Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before, nigga
When our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, ""Where do we go?"" Nigga
And we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga
I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow

Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinkin' of my partner, put the candy paintin' on the Regal
Diggin' in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Every day, my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico, ah
I don't talk about it, be about it, every day, I sequel
If I got it, then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all

Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers

I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct

Malibu,Miley Cyrus,12642,"I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean

I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'

I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us just for a while, do they even exist?

All Me,Drake,12584,"I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free, Randy

Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (Yeah)
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (2 Chainz)
No help, that's all me, all me for real

Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring, doggin' these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, ""Baby girl, fall in line""
Okay, made a million off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, ""Ill nigga alert, ill nigga alert""
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga, God bless you
If havin' a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (Tru)

Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of six
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
Goddamn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
Goddamn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself:
""You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help""
Cashing checks and I'm bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking 'bout who next, but I'm about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I'm the light-skinned Keith Sweat, I'ma make it last forever
It's not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I'm on the road box office sales
I'm getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
'Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just got paid like eight advances, goddamn

Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me—

Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle
But I still take my time (Time)
Man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro sh—, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...

Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year
I'll do King of Diamonds 3 more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section
Like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way
Sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that
They ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine
I let you eat like that
I been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back
(No more free Randy) I'm blessed than a muhfucka
Niggas been stressed than a muhfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a muhfucka
Damn that's a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don't listen to you
'Cause I don't like being lied to
And that ship won't sail
And that wind won't guide you
Daddy was in jail, we was talking through the window
Like a motherfucking drive-thru

and still waking up like the rent's due
not complicated, it's simple
i got sexy ladies, a whole benz full
and to them hoes i'm everything everything but gentle
but i still take my time
man, i guess i'm just old fashioned
wearing retro sh , that's old fashion
nigga, see what i'm saying, no closed caption
i paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
i plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
my new girl is on glee and shit
probably making more money than me and shit
i swear to god i got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
i got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
like i got trust issues
i'm sorry for the people i've pushed out
i'm the type to have a bullet proof condom
and still gotta pull out
but that's just me and i ain't perfect
i ain't a saint but i am worth it
if it's one thing, i am worth it
niggas still hating but it ain't working
lil' bitch...
oh me, oh me, oh my
i think i done fucked too many women from the 305
'fore the end of this year
i'll do king of diamonds 3 more times
smoking on that kush all in our section
like it's legalized
girl, you can't always have your way
sometimes it be like that
they don't really fuck with you like that
they ain't never did me like that
i just took my time, you got the shine
i let you eat like that
i been taught to never loan somebody
what you need right back
and i need that shit right back
 no more free randy i'm blessed than a muhfucka
niggas been stressed than a muhfucka
niggas getting nervous
clutching they chests like a muhfucka
damn that's a motherfucker
tell the truth, i don't listen to you
'cause i don't like being lied to
and that ship won't sail
and that wind won't guide you
daddy was in jail, we was talking through the window
like a motherfucking drive thru
that was back then, man
now my niggas rich enough to do whatever i do"

Lost Boy,Ruth B.,12549,"There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the Moon
And even sometimes he would go away too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for a while

He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely""
And ever since that day

I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored, we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run Lost Boy,"" they say to me
Away from all of reality
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free

He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny
As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough, we reached Neverland
Peacefully, my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day

I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored, we play in the woods

Neverland, I love you so, you are now my home sweet home
Forever a Lost Boy at last

You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up

I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
""You ain't bringin' Drake along?""

When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop

I'm attracted to her, or her attractive ass
And now we murderers, because we kill time

I hate to see her go but I love to watch her leave
But I keep her running back and forth; soccer team
Cold as a winter's day, hot as a summer's eve
Young Money thieves steal your love and leave

I like the way you walking if you walking my way

Let's buy a place, with all kind of space
I'll let you be the judge, and-and-and I'm the case

She don't ever wonder, 'cause she know she bad

She like romance and I like rolling with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscience is
She's watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN
But when that show ends, she all over my skin, lotion
Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin'
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like it's for posters and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: ""Don't you ever show this!""
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said ""Your words get me open""
So I closed it, where your clothes is?

She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck

And I just wanna see that thing drop
From the back, to the front, to the top

Forget about bills and the first of the month

my city treat me like a king, i should wear a crown
and i don't really fuck around
i gave my bitch two mil' 'cause she stuck around
1500, all in singles straight up! 
throw it up, watch it fall and drop
'round and 'round they go
'round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go
'round and 'round they go
i'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole
than to get down in a hole

'round and 'round they go
'round and 'round it go

A Thousand Years,Christina Perri,12216,"Heart beats fast, colors and promises
How to be brave? How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow

One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Time stands still, beauty in all she is

Stairway To Heaven,Led Zeppelin,12202,"There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there, she knows if the stores are all closed
With a word, she can get what she came for
Ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven

There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonder

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts, I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder

And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah-ho

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

And it makes me wonder
Ohh, oh-oh

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow?
And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind? Oh


And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one, and one is all, yeah
To be a rock and not to roll

Everyday,A$AP Rocky,12101,"[Chorus: Rod Stewart & 
Miguel
]
Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am
So every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fineWaiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slowHere I go, here I go, here I go

Uh, off again, there he go, to another dimension, my mind
Body, soul imprisoned, my eye probably goin' ballistic, but, listen
I'm missin' a couple of screws, they ain't never do drillin' true
You been sippin' away at the truth, a double shot of wisdom'll do
Do, do, rollin' through, hittin' switches
Rolling ditches, blowin' kisses, to the bitches, holdin' biscuits (Yeah)
What's the business? Beat the system
Co-defendants, blow the sentence, go to prison
Go to church and pray the father, Lord, forgive us (Amen)
And only God can judge me (Yeah)
And he don't like no ugly
I look so fuckin' good, most dykes'll fuck me, buddy
Yeah, I'm a piece of shit (Uh-huh), I know I plead the fifth
I tell her, ""Holler if ya need some dick""
The devotion is gettin' hopeless, but, hold it, I'm gettin' close
As my soul is, I'm seein' ghosts, a solo is now a poet
Hypnosis overdose on potions, adjustin' to the motions
And gettin' out all my emotions

Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am
So every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine (
Yeah
)
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
 (

Banana Pancakes,Jack Johnson,12049,"Well, can't you see that it's just raining?

Make you banana pancakes, pretend like it's the weekend now

There ain't no need to go outside

But just maybe

But the telephone singing, ringing, it's too early, don't pick it up
We don't need to
We got everything we need right here and everything we need is enough
Just so easy when
The whole world fits inside of your arms
Do we really need to pay attention to the alarm?

Bonfire,Childish Gambino,12027,"Okay, it's Childish Gambino, homegirl drop it like the NASDAQ
Move white girls like there's coke up my asscrack
Move Black girls 'cause, man, fuck it, I'll do either
I love pussy, I love bitches, dude, I should be runnin’ PETA
In Adidas, with some short shorts, B-O-O all over me
My green is where it's supposed to be, your green is in my grocery
This Asian dude, I stole his girl, and now he got that Kogi beef
My dick is like an accent mark, it's all about the over E's
Hot like a parked car
I sound weird like ""nigga"" with a hard 'R'
Fly like the logo on my cousin's 440
Eatin' Oreos like these white girls that blow me
Vodka for my ladies, whiskey for a grown man
Hangin' in the islands, lookin' for Earl like Toejam
I made the beat retarded, so I'm callin' it a slow jam
Butcher and I know it, man, kill beef, go ham
These rappers are afraid of him
'Cause I'm a beast, bitch, ""grrr"", 
Invader Zim
Gambino is a call girl, fuck you, pay me
Brand new whip for these niggas like slavery
Told me I was awful and that shit did not faze me
Tell me how I suck again, my memory is hazy
“You're my favorite rapper now”, yeah, dude, I better be
Or you can fuckin' kiss my ass, 
Human Centipede
You wanna see my girl? I ain't that dumb
You wanna see my girl? Check 
Maxim
""Man, why does every black actor gotta rap some?”
I don't know, all I know is I'm the best one

It's a bonfire, turn the lights out
I'm burnin' everything you mothafuckas talk about
It's a bonfire, turn the lights out
I'm burnin' everything you mothafuckas talk about

You know these rapper dudes talk shit, start killin'
Fuck that, got goons like an archvillain
I'm from the South, ain't got no accent, don't know why
So this rap is child's play, I do my name like Princess Di
Yeah, they say they want the realness, rap about my real life
Told me I should just quit, ""First of all, you talk white
Second off, you talk like you haven't given up yet""
Rap's stepfather, yeah, you hate me but you will respect
I put in work, ask Ludwig
Put my soul on the track like shoes did
Played this for my cousin, now he can't even think straight
Black and white music? Now, nigga, that's a mixtape
Shout out to my blerds, they represent the realness
Shout out to Gambino Girls, my dick is in the building
I know you hate me 'cause your little cousin play me out
I like Black girls who nerdy but when they dance they be sayin' ""Ow""
I'm sorry for who followed me
Chillin' with a Filipina at your local Jollibee
Yeah, I'm in her ass like sodomy
So if you see my hand under the table, don't bother me
I don't talk soft, that's that other guy
I'm screamin' ""What the fuck is up?"" like I ain't seen the sky

Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away? (Hey)","boys seem to like the girls who laugh at anything
the ones who get undressed before the second date
girls seem to like the boys who don't appreciate
all the money and the time that it takes
to be fly as a mother
got my both eyes out for mr. right
guessing i just don't know where to find 'em
but i hope they all come out tonight

where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
boys seem to like the girls who like to kiss and tell
talking them up about the things they do so well
but i'd rather find a boy who is down for the chase
putting in the time that it takes
to be fly as a mother
to supply all of my heart's demands
suit and tie, 'cause undercover
he's gonna save my life like superman

Angels (feat. Saba),Chance The Rapper,11862,"Angels, na, na, na, na

I got my city doing front flips
When every father, mayor, rapper jump ship
I guess that's why they call it where I stay
Clean up the streets, so my daughter can have somewhere to play
I'm the blueprint to a real man
Some of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal man
I ain't goin' to hell or to Hillman
Igh, Igh, Igh, Igh, for my real fans
I got caught up with a little Xan
Can't stop me but it slow me though
Yeah nigga famous, you don't know me though
But every DJ still play me though
Damn man, I don't even need a radio
And my new shit sound like a rodeo
Got the old folks dancing the Do-si-do
'Til they fuck around and sign me to OVO
Oooh, I just might share my next one with Keef
Got the industry in disbelief, they be asking for beef
This what it sound like when God split an atom with me
I even had Steve giving out apples for free

They was talking ""woo woo this woo wap da bam""
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me they keep me surrounded

Who is you? And who the fuck is you? And who is him?
All of the sudden woo wap da bam you can't touch me
Na, na, na, na I got angels
I got angels

I ain't change my number since the seventh grade
This for my day one, ten years, seven days
A week, niggas never tired on they Kevin Gates
And if they rest in peace they bunny hopping heaven's gates
It's too many young angels on the southside
Got us scared to let our grandmommas outside
You gon' make me take the campers way downtown
You gon' make me turn my BM to my housewife
I just had a growth spurt
It done took so long, my tippy toes hurt
You can keep the nose ring, I don't have to soul search
I'm still at my old church, only ever sold merch
Grandma say I'm Kosher, momma say I'm culture

Knee Deep (feat. Jimmy Buffett),Zac Brown Band,11827,"Going to put the the world away for a minute
Pretend I don't live in it
Sunshine going to wash my blues away
Had sweet love but I lost it
She got too close so I fought it
Now I'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way

Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

Wrote a note said be back in a minute
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody's going to miss me anyway
Mind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishing my condition ain't ever going to go away

Now I'm knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

This champagne shore washing over me
It's a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea
One day you could be as lost as me
Change your geography
Maybe you might be

Knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair

Never been so happy
Never felt so high

Oh for sho'Yeah
Check me out
[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & 
Snoop Dogg
]
It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How? Nigga, my last album was 
The Chronic
 (
Nigga
)
They wanna know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they wanna know how I feel about it
(
If you ain't up on thangs
)
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still puffin' my leaves, still fuck with the beats
Still not lovin' police (
Huh-uh
)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (For sho')
Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213 (
For life
)
Still the beats bang, still doin' my thang
Since I left ain't too much changed, still

I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world

Still

Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E

(
Still
) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E
.

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doin' fifty a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed: I smoke 'til I'm 'sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since ""Turn Out the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it, after mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through, then I give you (Still) D.R.E.

I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world

Laidback in the shack, play this track

I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king, but the ace is back
(
So if you ain't up on thangs
)
Dr. Dre be the name (What?), still runnin' the game
Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't trippin', love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more livin' hard (
Nah, nah

Barbeques every day, drivin' fancy cars (Hey, hey)
Still gon' get mine regardless (Still)

Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week, I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame

Break Up In A Small Town,Sam Hunt,11532,"I knew I'd see her around
I'd be at some party, she'd show up and I'd be walkin' out
Or across some parking lot, hidin' behind her sister
I'd look up, and she'd be at the red light beside me
In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back
I'd act like I didn't see her
We'd pay at the same pumps
Flip through the same stations
And slow down for the same curves
Run around with the same crowds
We just needed some time
She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine
Thought I would be fine, heh, but maybe not
I knew she'd find a way to get over me
But I'd never thought

She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes when you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

For a while I guess they were keeping it low-key
But now it's like these county lines, closin' in on me
I see 'em everywhere together
And it's hittin' a little too close to home
She's so far gone, but she didn't go far
She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
She's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard
In someone else's arms, right down the road
And I never thought

Her mailbox is seven minutes from mine
And I drive into town, sometimes and I see you sittin' there with him

Sometimes you worry 'bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft-spoken
I came to talk to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right if
I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you (Feeling you)
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla 'cause you know they 'bout to cut the lights on

Huh, I'm staring at you from afar
I'm wondering 'bout you, like where you from and who you are
'Cause you a star, no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type that light the night time
I heard you got a man, but who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out to zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still

Love The Way You Lie,Eminem,11457,"Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off of love, drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you"" — ""No, you ain't
Come back"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that’s the culprit, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—

Paint It Black,The Rolling Stones,11447,"I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

Poetic Justice,Kendrick Lamar,11397,"Every second, every minute, man, I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talkin' 'bout dark room, perfume
Go, go

(
In the thundering rain
)
I recognize your fragrance, hol' up, you ain't never gotta say shit, uh
And I know your taste is a little bit, mmm, high maintenance, uh
Everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, it's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em? I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off, fuck that
Pour up plenty of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty Range, I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs 'less I write it down for real, PS

I really hope you play this 'cause, oh, girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one-off vacations you've been takin'
Clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your mama to the motherland, I could do it
Maybe one day, when you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city and you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin and your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write 'em down for real, PS

(In the thundering rain)
Every time I write these words, they become a taboo
Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe, call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb and I can see power steerin'
Sex drive when you swerve, I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it, mhm

I Miss You,blink-182,11378,"I miss you, I miss you

Hello, there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night, we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

I miss you, miss you
I miss you, I miss you

Where are you? And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stared, I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

Debbie just hit the wall, she never had it all
One Prozac a day, husband's a CPA
Her dreams went out the door when she turned twenty-four
Only been with one man, what happened to her plan?

She was gonna be an actress, she was gonna be a star
She was gonna shake her ass on the hood of Whitesnake's car
Her yellow SUV is now the enemy
Looks at her average life, and nothing has been alright

Since Bruce Springsteen, Madonna, way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie, and music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school, they tell her that she's uncool
'Cause she's still preoccupied with 19, 19, 1985 (Woo-hoo-hoo)

She's seen all the classics, she knows every line
Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, even Saint Elmo's Fire
She rocked out to Wham!, not a big Limp Bizkit fan
Thought she'd get a hand on a member of Duran Duran

Where's the mini-skirt made of snake skin?
And who's the other guy that's singing in Van Halen?
When did reality become TV?
Whatever happened to sitcoms, game shows?

Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League

I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns

This Town,Niall Horan,11227,"Waking up to kiss you and nobody’s there
The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
It’s hard
Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running round
It’s funny how things never change in this old town
So far from the stars

And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met he’s got his arms around you
It’s so hard
So hard

And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

Because if the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

And I know that it’s wrong
That I can’t move on
But there’s something about you

If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

Yeah, this album is dedicated
To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby

It was all a dream, I used to read 
Word Up!

Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday 
Rap Attack
, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bambú, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood, it's all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

Money, hoes and clothes

But not that many (

I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moët and Alizé keep me pissy, girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff
I was too used to packing gats and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Living life without fear
Puttin' five karats in my baby girl ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

You know very well (

Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur

 please take me away from here 
'cause i feel like such an insomniac
 please take me away from here 
why do i tire of counting sheep
 please take me away from here 
when i'm far too tired to fall asleep?
to ten million fireflies, i'm weird 'cause i hate goodbyes
i got misty eyes as they said farewell they said farewell 
but i'll know where several are if my dreams get real bizarre
'cause i saved a few and i keep them in a jar jar, jar, jar 
i'd like to make myself believe
that planet earth turns slowly
it's hard to say that i'd rather stay awake when i'm asleep
'cause everything is never as it seems when i fall asleep 
i'd like to make myself believe
that planet earth turns slowly
it's hard to say that i'd rather stay awake when i'm asleep

that planet earth turns slowly
it's hard to say that i'd rather stay awake when i'm asleep

Take a Walk,Passion Pit,11157,"All these kinds of places make it seem like it's been ages
Tomorrow, some new building will scrape the sky
I love this country dearly, I can feel the ladder clearly
But I never thought I'd be alone to try
Once, I was outside Penn Station selling red and white carnations
We were still alone, my wife and I
Before we married, saved my money, brought my dear wife over
Now I work to bring my family stateside

But off the boat, they stayed a while, then scattered across the coast
Once a year I'll see them for a week or so at most

I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk (Oh)
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk (Oh)

Practice isn't perfect, but the market cuts a loss
I remind myself that times could be much worse
My wife won't ask me questions, there's not so much to ask
And she'll never flaunt around an empty purse
Once, my mother-in-law came just to stay a couple nights
Then decided she would stay the rest of her life
I watch my little children play some board game in the kitchen
And I sit and pray they never feel my strife

But then my partner called to say the pension funds were gone
He made some bad investments, now the accounts are overdrawn

I took a walk

We had taxes, we had bills, we had a lifestyle to front
And, tonight, I swear I'll come home and we'll make love like we're young
Tomorrow, you'll cook dinner for the neighbors and their kids
We can rip apart those socialists and all their damn taxes
But see I am no criminal, I'm down on both bad knees
I'm just too much a coward to admit when I'm in need

You looked at me, and I was done
But we were just getting started

I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang, ""Oh""
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin', ""Don't go""

When I think about you, I think about 17
I think about my old Jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen

I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name I bet there'd still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm

Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear ""Born in the USA""
Do you relive those glory days
So long ago?

When you think about me, do you think about 17?
Do you think about my old Jeep?
Think about the stars in the sky?

Someone Like You,Adele,11119,"I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Never mind, I'll find someone like you

but i couldn't stay away, i couldn't fight it
i had hoped you'd see my face
and that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
never mind, i'll find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you, too
don't forget me, i beg
i remember you said
sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
you know how the time flies
only yesterday was the time of our lives
we were born and raised in a summer haze
bound by the surprise of our glory days
i hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
but i couldn't stay away, i couldn't fight it
i had hoped you'd see my face
and that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
never mind, i'll find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you, too
don't forget me, i beg
i remember you said
sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
nothing compares, no worries or cares
regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
never mind, i'll find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you
don't forget me, i beg
i remember you said
sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
never mind, i'll find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you, too
don't forget me, i beg
i remember you said
sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"
House Of The Rising Sun,The Animals,11106,"There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And, God, I know I'm one

My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's all drunk


Oh, mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun

Well, I got one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

Baby girl ass jiggle like she want more
Like she a groupie and I ain't even on tour
Maybe cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore
Or maybe cause she heard that I buy out the stores
Bottom of the 9th and a nigga gotta score
If not I gotta move on to the next whore
Here comes the 3 to the 2 to the 1
Homeboy trippin' he don't know I got a gun
When it come to poppin we do shit for fun
You ain't got one nigga you betta run
Now I'm in the back gettin head from my hunz
While she goin down I'm breakin down what I done
She smokin my blunt sayin she ain't havin fun

Said she got a kid but she got her tubes tied
If you 21 girl that's alright
I wonder if a shake comin with them fries
If so baby can I get em super sized
Here comes the 4 to the 3 to the 2
She started feelin on my johnson right out the blue
Girl you super thick so I'm thinkin that's cool
But instead of 1 lifestyle I need 2
Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels
Expression on her face like she ain't got a clue

Drop an EP on a nigga for the free-free on a nigga
Yeah you ZZ on a nigga, king like BB on you niggas
Rock with Champagne P

And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
Yeah, the party never end, this life is what I recommend

Scars To Your Beautiful,Alessia Cara,10976,"She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor

Oh, she don't see the light that's shinin'
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made
But

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's
Starving, you know, covergirls eat nothin'
She says, ""Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything, what's a little bit of hunger?
I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away

She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurtin', let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

you don't know me
i don't know you
but i want to
and i don't wanna steal your freedom
i don't wanna change your mind
i don't have to make you love me
i just wanna take your time
i don't wanna wreck your friday
i ain't gonna waste my lines
i don't have to take your heart
i just wanna take your time
and i know it starts with ""hello""
the next thing you know you try to be nice
and some guys gettin' too close
trying to pick you up
trying to get you drunk
and i'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
'cause she's supposed to save you from random guys that talk too much
and wanna stay too long
it's the same old song
and dance, but i think you know it well
you could've rolled your eyes, told me to go to hell
could've walked away, but you're still here
and i'm still here
come on, let's see where it goes
i don't wanna steal your freedom
i don't wanna change your mind
i don't have to make you love me
i just wanna take your time
i don't have to meet your mother
we don't have to cross that line
i don't wanna steal your covers
i just wanna take your time
woah
i don't wanna go home with you
woah
i just wanna be alone with you
i don't wanna steal your freedom freedom 
i don't wanna change your mind
i don't have to make you love me you love me 
i just wanna take your time
i don't wanna blow your phone up
i just wanna blow your mind
i don't have to take your heart
i just wanna take your time
no, i ain't gotta call you ""baby""
and i ain't gotta call you mine
i don't have to take your heart
i just wanna take your time

The A Team,Ed Sheeran,10820,"White lips, pale face

Burnt lungs, sour taste

Been this way since eighteen, but lately

Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries

Tried to swim and stay afloat

Somebody That I Used To Know,Gotye,10726,"Now and then, I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy, you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember


You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that, though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know


Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way

[Verse 2: Kelly Price &

So why send oppression, not blessings?
Why, oh, why'd You do me wrong? (
More
)
You persecute the weak
Because it makes You feel so strong (
Safe
)
Don't have much strength to fight
So I look to the light (
War
)
To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, 'cause I know that You'll make everything alright
And I know that You'll take good care of Your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
'Cause I, I look to the light

When they come for You, I will shield Your name
I will field their questions, I will feel Your pain
No one can judge
They don't, they don't know
They don't know

Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted, Pangaea
I'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean, I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap, the bam
Tryna snap photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made “Sunday Candy,” I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said, ""Let's do a good ass job with '
Chance 3
'""
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride, I'ma still give 'em raincoats
Know what God said when He made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, 'cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil' Chano from 79th

We on an ultralight beam

Work Song,Hozier,10564,"Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

Boys workin' on empty
Is that the kinda way to face the burnin' heat?
I just think about my baby
I'm so full of love, I could barely eat
There's nothin' sweeter than my baby
I'd never want once from the cherry tree
'Cause my baby's sweet as can be
She'd give me toothaches just from kissin' me

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

Boys, when my baby found me
I was three days on a drunken sin
I woke with her walls around me
Nothin' in her room but an empty crib
And I was burnin' up a fever
I didn't care much how long I lived
But I swear, I thought I dreamed her
She never asked me once about the wrong I did

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

My babe would never fret none
About what my hands and my body done
If the Lord don't forgive me
I'd still have my baby and my babe would have me
When I was kissin' on my baby
And she put her love down, soft and sweet
In the low lamplight, I was free
Heaven and hell were words to me

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her","mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

That's My Kind Of Night,Luke Bryan,10514,"Uh, uh

I got that real good, feel good stuff
Up under the seat of my big black jacked up truck
Rollin' on 35's, pretty girl by my side
You got that sun tan skirt and boots
Waiting on you to look my way and scoot
Your little hot self over here
Girl, hand me another beer, yeah

All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin' down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that's my kind of night

Might sit down on my diamond plate tailgate

So thankful for that, it's such a blessin', yeah
Turn every situation into heaven, yeah
Oh, you are
My sunrise on the darkest day
Got me feelin' some kind of way
Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly
You fit me, tailor-made love, how you put it on
Got the only key, know how to turn it on
The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear
Baby, take it slow so we can last long

Oh, you, you are the magnet and I'm the metal

Hop on, hop on!)

I want to see your hair dance
I want to be your rhythm
And you show my mouth
Your favorite places
(Favorite, favorite, baby)
Let me surpass your danger zones
To make you scream
And you forget your last name

If I ask you for a kiss, come, give it to me
I know that you're thinking about it
I've been trying for a while
Baby, this is giving and giving it
You know that your heart with mine makes you go bang-bang
You know that she is looking for my bang-bang
Come, taste from my mouth to see what it tastes like
I want to, I want to, I want to see how much love you can take in
I am not in a hurry, I want to take the trip
Let's start slow, then wild

Step by step, smooth and gentle
We're sticking together, little by little
When you kiss me with such skill
I see that you're malice with tenderness
Step by step, smooth and gentle
We start sticking, little by little
And such beauty is a puzzle
But to solve it here I have the piece

Mirrors,Justin Timberlake,10490,"Aren't you somethin' to admire?
'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side

'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'll be tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong

'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now

Aren't you somethin', an original?
'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
And I can't help but stare, 'cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes

The Cave,Mumford & Sons,10460,"It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind
The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

'Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind
So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's land

So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say
'Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be

And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again","it's empty in the valley of your heart

Car Radio,Twenty One Pilots,10367,"I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire, exhale desire
I know it's dire, my time today
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence

Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it, my pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve, my skin will scream
Reminding me of who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving, there's no hiding for me
I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence

I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep, please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound
There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And-a from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win and fear will lose
And there's faith and there's sleep
We need to pick one, please, because
Faith is to be awake and to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

A Tale of 2 Citiez,J. Cole,10334,"Uh

Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
Look at me, my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees, my nigga
Used to want a Pathfinder with some tints
That's all I need, my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it rinsed
But now I see, my nigga
That the world's a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper
And they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limits
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
Yeah, can I get a glimpse?

Last night I had a bad dream (Bad dream, bad dream)
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing? (Bad thing, bad thing)
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things?
(What's the value of a thing?) Guess not
Last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like—
Ugh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

Small town nigga, Hollywood dreams
I know that everything that glitters ain't gold
I know the shit ain't always good as it seems
But tell me 'til you get it how could you know?
How could you know? (How could you know? How could you know? How could you know? How could you know? How could you know?)
How could you know? (How could you know? How could you know? How could you know? How could you know? How could you know?)

Listen up, I'm 'bout to go and get rich
Fuck with me, my nigga
We gon' circle 'round the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some trees, my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see, my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And that's the key, my nigga
Listen up, I'm 'bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to, nigga
Me, I want my pockets fat, a badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too, nigga
Watch some rollers in a fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do, nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let 'em kill your dream
It'll haunt you, nigga, haunt you

Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
I look around like—
Do you wanna be another nigga, that ain't never had things? (What's the value of a thing?)
Guess not

(You know what the fuck it is, nigga, run that shit right now)
Uh, nice watch, run it

Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

Father forgive me for my childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command
But before you go I've got to warn you now
Whatever goes up surely must come down
And you'll get your piece, but know peace won't be found
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man

Yeah, I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem, hola, my Dominicanos (
Dímelo
)
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruisin' down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say ""What up?"" to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives

But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the meltin' pot, corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners, it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add

Everybody ride her, just like a bus route

(Na-na-na, na, na, na, na)

I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating (Hey)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits (Fuck you, Debbie)

Now, this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention, please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

Now, this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now, let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

i'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
testing, ""attention, please""
feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
a nuisance, who sent? you sent for me?
now, this looks like a job for me
so, everybody, just follow me
'cause we need a little controversy
'cause it feels so empty without me
i said this looks like a job for me
so, everybody, just follow me
'cause we need a little controversy
'cause it feels so empty without me
a tisket, a tasket, i'll go tit for tat wit'
anybody who's talkin', ""this shit, that shit""
chris kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
worse than them little limp bizkit bastards
and moby? you can get stomped by obie
you thirty six year old bald headed fag, blow me
you don't know me, you're too old, let go
it's over, nobody listens to techno
now, let's go, just give me the signal
i'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
i've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
ever since prince turned himself into a symbol
but, sometimes, the shit just seems
everybody only wants to discuss me
so this must mean i'm disgusting
but it's just me, i'm just obscene
though i'm not the first king of controversy
i am the worst thing since elvis presley
to do black music so selfishly
and use it to get myself wealthy
there's a concept that works
twenty million other white rappers emerge
but no matter how many fish in the sea
it'd be so empty without me
now, this looks like a job for me
so, everybody, just follow me
'cause we need a little controversy
'cause it feels so empty without me
i said this looks like a job for me

Down On Me,Jeremih,10283,"She want it, I can tell she want it
Want me to push up on it 'fore she know when I'm all on it
We get the party goin', liquor flowin', this is fire
50 and Jeremih, number one, there's nothing higher (Oh! Won't you go and—)
Get it, get it, work it, work it (I see you, baby, haha)
Break it, break it, down, down (Won't you just put it down on me?)
(Won't you go and—) Get it, get it, work it, work it (Put it down on)
Break it, break it, down

Okay, she headed to the dance floor and she slowly start to poppin' it
Somethin' like my wrist piece, everybody got to watchin' it
Girl, you got that secret treasure, I'm gon' put a lock on it
Don't care what they say, I would be stupid to be not on it
Ms. Vicky, heard you got that sticky
Let's go and take nine shots, we'll just call it fifty
And I'm gonna lick it, lick it, lick it
'Til her hicky ha-ha-have her river runnin'
Keep you gunnin' 'til you empty (Bang, bang, bang, bang)
Oh-oh, you look so sweet
What you work at Bally's? Look at your physique
Girl, you are a beauty, well-well, I am a beast
They must have been trippin' to have let me off a leash

Shorty, you a dime, why you lookin' lonely?
Go buy another round and it's all on me

System's thumpin', party jumpin', shorty, she's a perfect ten
She rock her hips, then roll her hips, then drop it down like it's nothin'
She shaped just like an hourglass, just how fast an hour passed
Time flies when I'm on that ass, but I won't put your shit on blast
Work it like a pro, pro, pro, sit and watch it go, go, go
Do her thing all on the flo', she bounce it fast and shake it slow
So sexual, incredible, she beautiful, she edible
I got her, I won't let her go, I ain't seen nothing better, yo (Yeah)
Look at how she twerk it, the way she work it
Make me wanna hit it, hit it, heaven when I'm in it, in it (Oh, oh, yeah)

Biggie Smalls
Listen...
Uh yeah baby oooooooh, listen to me, oh yeaaaah
When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the thriller in Manila
Honeys call me Bigga the condom filler
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the ep along by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with the dick, make your kidneys shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I'm in thirteens, know what I mean
I fuck around and hit you with the Hennessey dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder, it doesn't matter
Skinny or fat or boy-skinned or black, baby I drop
These boricua mommies screamin ""Ay papi!""
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled propa
Look, I gotcha caught up in the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote da fo'-fo'
For niggas gettin mad cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G ya see
All I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Gettin Physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So gimme a hoe, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her till her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-town in ya, you'll want that old thing back
What you wanna do?
I got that old thing back
What you wanna see?
Baby sing relax and feel
What you be, where you are
You wouldn't start
Bitches screamin they want That old thing back
Like B I Double G I E
Wit some new R-U-L-E
Notorious known to bustin in ya E-Y-E, baby baby!
Bitches know they love and hate me
I come, you come, we come, with back some maybe
How close we came to come the ghetto is crazy
How come you ain't, ?? semi your faces
When I come you be cryin like I'm killin ya bitches
Knows when picture in the camera rollin
Cause I only be knowin how the shit's unfolded
Back shots to the rear, got the mac unloaded
Got a reload, like every so often
You sayin I got my swagger back
I'm lookin like bitch, my swagger never left
It's so hard pressed, to be impressed by these new rappers
They actors, and the fact is, you want that old thing back
Shit...
Is my mind playin tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, havin nightmares of girls killin me
She mad because what we had didn't last
I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past let's dwell on the 500 SL, the E and J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rim with Benjamins
Another hon's in the crib, please send her in
I fuck nonstop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits alot
But lickin clits had to stop
Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow, really though
I got the cleanest meanest penis, ya never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Tim boots and your bodysuit
I mean the spandex and hit my man next
Sex gettin rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don't chase em, I replace em
And if I'm caressin em, I'm undressin em
Fuck whatcha heard who's the best in New York
For fillin fantasies without that nigga Mr. Walk
Or Tattoo I got you wrapped around my dick
And when I'm done I got to split shit
Back shots is my position, I gotcha wishin for an intermission
Fuck the kissin, lickin down to your belly button, I ain't frontin

Take Care,Drake,10123,"I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (
I'll take, I'll take
)
I've loved and I've lost

I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinkin' that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, aw
Pushing me away so I give her space, aw
Dealin' with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I would care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to hide
And you've seen all my mistakes

That you're the antidote to everything except for me

Burn everything you love, then burn the ashes

The Monster,Eminem,9948,"I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

I wanted the fame but not the cover of 
Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Woo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm—

Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it 'cause you never know when it
All could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes, I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders, no wonder
You're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
(
New-hoo, ooh-hoo
) Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think it went wanderin' off down, yonder and stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist to intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—

Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and I'm comin' straight at
MCs, blood gets spilled then I'll
Take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children, but if one kid
Out of a hundred million who are goin' through a
Struggle feels it and relates, that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back in the draft
Turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spin, Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—

Take It Easy,Eagles,9822,"Well, I'm running down the road tryin' to loosen my load

Shit
Ah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Uh

Just wakin' up in the mornin', gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barkin' from the dog, no smog
And mama cooked the breakfast with no hog (Damn)
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out (What's up?)
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', ""Will I live another twenty-four?""
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
""Which park are y'all playin' basketball?""
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple-double
Freakin' niggas every way like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day (Shit)

Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' 
Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas
And watch me break 'em with the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven
Seven, even back door Little Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin', ""Domino""
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A.​ 
Today was a good day (Shit)

Left my nigga's house paid (Word)
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep, put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun (Yeah)
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out (Uh)
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for a murder
Two in the mornin', got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read, ""Ice Cube's a Pimp"" (Yeah)
Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
Halfway home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK

I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet, and wild
There must be somethin' in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
Layin' underneath the palm trees (Yeah, yeah, undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryna creep a little sneak peek (What? What? What? At us)

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Roar,Katy Perry,9660,"I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion

Welcome to the Black Parade,My Chemical Romance,9638,"When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up, would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned?""
He said, ""Will you defeat them, your demons
And all the non-believers, the plans that they have made?
Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom
To lead you in the summer to join the black parade""
When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up, would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned?""

Sometimes, I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times, I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know

We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And in my heart, I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it

A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back, and let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end, we hear the call

To carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

On and on, we carry through the fears (Oh, ha, ha)
Disappointed faces of your peers (Oh, ha, ha)
Take a look at me, 'cause I could not care at all

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar
And give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are

You're laying waste to Halloween
You fucked it, friend, it's on its head, it struck the street
You're in Milwaukee, off your feet

And at once, I knew
I was not magnificent

Strayed above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles

Third and Lake, it burnt away, the hallway
Was where we learned to celebrate
Automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
That night you played me ""Lip Parade""
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
Saying nothing, that's enough for me

And at once, I knew
I was not magnificent

Hulled far from the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles

Christmas night, it clutched the light, the hallow bright
Above my brother, I, and tangled spines
We smoked the screen to make it what it was to be
Now, to know it in my memory

And at once, I knew
I was not magnificent

High above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles","""someway, baby, it's part of me, apart from me""

Take all the courage you have left
And waste it on fixing all the problems
That you made in your own head

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line

With the big wide windows, with the suicide doors
Ain't no blood on my money, ain't no Twitter in Heaven
I know them drugs isn't close, ain't no visitin' Heaven
I know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions
Like my ex-girl getting pregnant
And her becoming my everything
I'm at war with my wrongs, I'm writing four different songs
I never forged it or forfeited, I'm a force to be reconciled
They want four-minute songs
You need a four-hour praise dance performed every morn
I'm feeling shortness of breath, so Nico grab you a horn
Hit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, ugh

 the blessings come down 
when the praises go up, the blessings come down
 it seems like blessings keep falling in my lap 
the blessings come down
when the praises go up, the blessings come down
 good god 
they booked the nicest hotels on the 59th floor
with the big wide windows, with the suicide doors
ain't no blood on my money, ain't no twitter in heaven
i know them drugs isn't close, ain't no visitin' heaven
i know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions
like my ex girl getting pregnant
and her becoming my everything
i'm at war with my wrongs, i'm writing four different songs
i never forged it or forfeited, i'm a force to be reconciled
they want four minute songs
you need a four hour praise dance performed every morn
i'm feeling shortness of breath, so nico grab you a horn
hit jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, ugh
 good god 
i'm gon' praise him, praise him 'til i'm gone
 good god 
i'm gon' praise him, praise him 'til i'm gone
when the praises go up, good god the blessings come down
 the blessings come down 
when the praises go up, the blessings come down
 the blessings come down 
when the praises go up, the blessings come down
 are you ready for your blessings? 
when the praises go up, the blessings come down
 are you ready for your miracle? 
are you ready, are you ready?
are you ready, are you ready?
are you ready, are you ready?
are you ready, are you ready?
it seems like blessings keep falling in my lap"

The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

I would still be holdin' you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fuckin' love song, I'll be sick, oh

You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine (Oh)
I don't expect you to care (Yeah)
I know I said it before, but
All of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed (Oh)
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone, tryin' to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Oh, oh)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two? (Yeah)
If happy-ever-afters did exist
I would still be holdin' you like this

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa & 
Adam Levine
]
Man, fuck that shit
I be out spendin' all this money while you sittin' 'round
Wonderin' why it wasn't you who came up from nothin'
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me, I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Tellin' me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you coulda saw, but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up, valet open doors
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go and take that little piece of shit with you (
Yeah

With his mans, hammer in his hands, feelin' like the man
Run, mothafucka, run
Before the popo get the gun, put it to your brain like goddamn!
Everybody know you ain't about it

This is merely the beginning again

Looking for something to complete us

I should be ashamed to be black
And some black people look ashamed when I rap
Like my great granddaddy didn’t take a whip to the back
Not accepted by the black or the white

I See Fire,Ed Sheeran,9424,"Oh, misty eye of the mountain below

i see fire, blood in the breeze
and i hope that you remember me
and if the night is burning, i will cover my eyes
for if the dark returns, then my brothers will die
and as the sky is fallin' down, it crashed into this lonely town
and with that shadow upon the ground, i hear my people screamin' out
now i see fire inside the mountain

Cherry Wine - Live,Hozier,9412,"Her eyes and words are so icy
Oh, but she burns like rum on a fire
Hot and fast and angry as she can be
I walk my days on a wire

It looks ugly, but it's clean
Oh mama, don't fuss over me

The way she tells me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist, oh, would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

Calls of guilty thrown at me, all while she stains
The sheets of some other
Thrown at me so powerfully, just like she throws
With the arm of her brother

But I want it, it's a crime
That she's not around most of the time

The way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist, oh, would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine


Her fight and fury's fiery
Oh, but she loves like sleep to the freezing
Sweet and right and merciful, I'm all but washed
In the tide of her breathing

And it's worth it, it's divine
I have this some of the time

Barefoot Blue Jean Night,Jake Owen,9403,"A full moon shining bright
Edge of the water; we were feeling alright
Back down a country road
The girls are always hot, and the beer is ice cold
Cadillac, horns on the hood
My buddy Frankie had his dad hook him up good
Girls smile when we roll by
They hop in the back, and we cruise to the river side

Never gonna grow up
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show
We were doin' it right
We were comin' alive
Yeah, caught up in a Southern summer, a barefoot, blue jean night

Blue eyes and auburn hair
Sittin' lookin' pretty by the fire in a lawn chair
New to town, and new to me
Her ruby red lips was sippin' on sweet tea
Shot me in love like a shootin' star
So, I grabbed a beer and my ol' guitar
Then we sat around till the break of dawn
Howlin' and singin' our favorite song

Never gonna grow up

He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
But fuck 'em, he knows the code, it's not about the salary
It's all about reality and making some noise
Making a story, making sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down, Tak's picking it up, let's go

Who the hell is he, anyway? He never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leaving 'em star-struck
Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact
That many misjudge him 'cause he makes a living from writing raps
Put it together himself, now the picture connects
Never asking for someone's help (Help), or to get some respect ('Spect)
He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
And now it all unfolds the skill of an artist

This is twenty percent skill (Uh), eighty percent beer
Be a hundred percent clear, 'cause Ryu is ill (Next)
Who would've thought he'd be the one to set the west in flames
Then I heard him wreck it with The Crystal Method ""Name of the Game"" (Uh-huh)
Came back, dropped ""Megadef,"" took 'em to church
I like ""Bleach"", man, Ryu had the stupidest verse (Ha-ha)
This dude is the truth, now, everybody giving him guest spots
His stock's through the roof, I heard he fucking with S. Dot

This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

They call him Ryu the Sick, and he's spitting fire with Mike
Got him out the dryer, he's hot, found him in Fort Minor with Tak
What a fucking nihilist, porcupine, he's a prick, he's a cock
The type women wanna be with and rappers hope he gets shot
Eight years in the making, patiently waiting to blow
Now, the record with Shinoda's taking over the globe
He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope
You won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat

Tak, he's not your everyday on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got, making his way to the top
He often gets a comment on his name, people keep asking him
""Was it given at birth or does it stand for an acronym?""
No, he's living proof (Proof), got him rocking the booth
He'll get you buzzing quicker than a shot of vodka with juice (Juice)
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they do and give a hundred percent

Forget Mike, nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he writes every note and he writes every line
And I've seen him at work, when that light goes on in his mind
It's like a design is written in his head, every time
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
And those motherfuckers he runs with, the kids that he signed?
Ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it?

This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill

Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain

Someone New,Hozier,9331,"Go and take this the wrong way
You knew who I was with every step that I ran to you
Only blue or black days
Electin' strange perfections in any stranger I choose

Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey, there is no right way

And so I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new

There's an art to life's distraction
To somehow escape the burning wait, the art of scrapin' through
Some like to imagine
The dark caress of someone else, I guess any thrill will do

Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey, there is no right way

And so I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new

I wake at the first cringe of morning
And my heart's already sinned
How pure, how sweet a love, Aretha
That you would pray for him

'Cause God knows I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new

He was a punk, she did ballet

He wanted her, she'd never tell
Secretly, she wanted him as well

And they had a problem with his baggy clothes

He was a skater boy, she said, ""See you later, boy""

Not Afraid,Eminem,9316,"(I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid) Yeah
(To take a stand, to take a stand) It's been a ride
(Everybody, everybody) I guess I had to
(Come take my hand, come take my hand) Go to that place to get to this one
(We'll walk this road together, through the storm) Now some of you
(Whatever weather, cold or warm) Might still be in that place
(Just lettin' you know that you're not alone) If you're tryna get out
(Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road) Just follow me, I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it
I don't give a damn what you think, I'm doin' this for me
So fuck the world, feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From 
Infinite
 down to the last 
Relapse
 album
He's still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game like a ""Fuck you"" for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings, instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last 
Relapse
 CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road (Same road, same road)

And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me, you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar, I'd shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazin', and

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road (Same road, same-)","i'm not afraid, i'm not afraid yeah
 to take a stand, to take a stand it's been a ride
 everybody, everybody i guess i had to
 come take my hand, come take my hand go to that place to get to this one
 we'll walk this road together, through the storm now some of you
 whatever weather, cold or warm might still be in that place
 just lettin' you know that you're not alone if you're tryna get out
 holla if you feel like you've been down the same road just follow me, i'll get you there
you can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before i lay 'em
but you won't take the sting out these words before i say 'em
'cause ain't no way i'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
when i say i'ma do somethin', i do it
i don't give a damn what you think, i'm doin' this for me
so fuck the world, feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
i'ma be what i set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtedly
and all those who look down on me, i'm tearin' down your balcony
no ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
from
infinite
down to the last
relapse
album
he's still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
whichever comes first, for better or worse
he's married to the game like a ""fuck you"" for christmas
his gift is a curse, forget the earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
and fuck the whole universe
i'm not afraid, i'm not afraid
to take a stand, to take a stand
everybody, everybody
come take my hand, come take my hand
we'll walk this road together, through the storm
whatever weather, cold or warm
just lettin' you know that you're not alone
holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
i shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
you said you was king, you lied through your teeth
for that, fuck your feelings, instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
and to the fans, i'll never let you down again, i'm back
i promise to never go back on that promise

"You're Gonna Go Far, Kid",The Offspring,9310,"Show me how to lie, you're getting better all the time

And no one even knew it was really only you
And now you steal away, take him out today
Nice work you did, you're gonna go far, kid

With a thousand lies and a good disguise
Hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes
When you walk away, nothing more to say
See the lightning in your eyes, see 'em running for their lives

Slowly outta line and drifting closer in your sight
So play it out, I'm wide-awake, it's a scene about me
There's something in your way and now someone is gonna pay
And if you can't get what you want, well, it's all because of me

If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the ""no""s on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

In Catholic school, as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
And I held my tongue as she told me, ""Son
Fear is the heart of love,"" so I never went back

If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the ""no""s on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

You and me have seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary and the soles of your shoes
Are all worn down, the time for sleep is now
But it's nothing to cry about 'cause we'll hold each other soon
In the blackest of rooms

And if Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
And illuminate the ""no""s on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

Then I'll follow you into the dark","love of mine, someday you will die
but i'll be close behind, i'll follow you into the dark
no blinding light or tunnels to gates of white
just our hands clasped so tight, waiting for the hint of a spark
if heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied
illuminate the ""no""s on their vacancy signs
if there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
then i'll follow you into the dark
in catholic school, as vicious as roman rule
i got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black

I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None will level on the line
Nobody offered his word,"" hey


""No reason to get excited""
The thief, he kindly spoke
""There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke, but, uh
But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate

The hour's getting late, hey


Hey

All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too, well, uh
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl, hey

Let's Get Lost,G-Eazy,9251,"Take me down
Take me all the way down tonight, soon I'll be leaving
Break me down
Break me all the way down, before the night is over
(Over)
Let's get lost, Let's get lost
Let's get lost, Let's get lost

What it is, what it could be?
My imagination runs fast
Only if you comin' with me
4 AM, staying up past
Or however long these drugs last
Don't know why I live so fast
They be telling me to slow down
I be screaming out ""fuck that!""
I really wanna take you down
Moaning is how I wanna make you sound
Can't wait until I get you home
Fuck that, I wanna take you now
Let's do it all - have a ball
Hook up tonight in the ladies' room stall
Follow you there, I'll let you make the call
You can text all your friends say you'll see them tomorrow
That's if you're down
She never fucked the first night until now
Let me, plow
Faded, I'm drunk off the brown
Stayed up all night on the town
Act like tomorrow just doesn't exist
Time isn't real, ain't shit on my wrists
Let go of everything, then you have bliss
Then she told me this

Take me down

Break me down

Let's get lost, Let's get lost

Let's get lost tonight
You can be supreme Kate Moss tonight
Turn up in the Soho loft tonight
Do drugs, take 10 shots tonight
Awesome, I'm naked with Naked and Famous jeans on the floor
Live a wild life, you ain't seen this before
You should give brains and I mean this for sure
That's what genius is for
Beautiful girl that I just met on tour
Another good girl that I'll probably destroy
Her life was stable until she met me
Sheltered and safe, so she never gets freed
But she loves trouble, she's drawn to the danger
Never goes crazy, I bet I can change her
I could make her fall in love with a stranger
Switch up the pace, I don't mean Danny Granger
Can't wait until tomorrow? I'm fine with today
You pretty as fuck and I'm tryna slay
""Let's do this right now"" is what I'm trying to say
I can tell you don't love him, you're dying to stray
I do not give a fuck 'bout your ex
I'm not looking for love, I'm just looking for sex
Tension between us had me feeling vexed
Then she sent me a text...

Take me down

Break me down
Break me all the way down, before the night is over
(over)
Let's get lost, Let's get lost
Let's get lost, Let's get lost

That's that endless summer, never going back to school
We do what we wanna, can't tell me no rules
Every night on the town, going out all the time
And I'm tryna take you down, only thing on my mind

Make You Miss Me,Sam Hunt,9246,"You hear a new song, and it's your favorite

You change your mind on it

You burn out like a match
Keep the slip knot in the strings you attach

Glorious (feat. Skylar Grey),Macklemore,9196,"You know I'm back, like I never left (I never left)
Another sprint, another step (Another step)
Another day, another breath (Another breath)
Been chasing dreams, but I never slept (I never slept)
I got a new attitude and a lease on life and some peace of mind
Seek and I find, I can sleep when I die
Want a piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
And shit I'm straight, I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?
I heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave
And the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name
So when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave?
Did I look out for the people, or did I do it all for fame?
Legend, it's exodus, searching for euphoria
Trudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us
Got 20,000 deep off in the street like we some warriors
My mama told me never bow your head, woo

I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious

I'm feeling glorious
The crib looking Victorian (Oh yes it is)
You know that we been going in (Been going in)
Since we hopped out that DeLorean (DeLorean, yeah we win)
En garde, things are just things, they don't make you who you are
Can't pack up a U-Haul and take it with you when you're gone
We posted on the porch, my family's glasses to the stars
My grandma smiling down on me like ""Woo, that boy got bars""
Okay, okay, yes I do
I said amen and hallelujah, let me testify too
Another morning, a morning, won't let self get in my way
I got my breath, I got my faith and I remember why I came, woo

She don't got time for a whole
Lil' bit of time that we have
We used to purchase a half
It don't be no time to smoke
I'm always throwing on clothes
She always throwing a fit
We don't got no time for no sex
I just put milk in the bowl
She don't be cooking at all
She just put weed in the bowl
She don't have time for herself
She putting points on the board, yes
You know she carry her own
You know she carry the child
She wake up at crack of dawn
She don't be cracking a smile
So when she packing the bowl
I grab her, I tell her

Let me crack this blunt
Slow it down for a second
Break it down, ooh
She said, ""Let me lick this blunt""
Slow it down for a second
Break it down, ooh
We deserve, we deserve (We deserve)
We deserve a smoke break

Truth being told
We used to movies and bowl
We used to Netflix and roll
I used to pass her the smoke
She used to laugh at my jokes

but you can't have a man look at you for five seconds
without you being insecure
you never credit yourself, so when you got older
it seems like you came back ten times over
now you're sittin' here in this damn corner
looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder
see you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
how to love, how to love, mm
see you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
now you in this corner, tryna put it together
how to love, ah, how to love, mm
for a second you were here , now you over there
it's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
like you never had a love , uh, had a love
oh, and you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
the fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
but it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
to be the one here talking to me, be the one listenin', but
but i admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
just as much as you admire bartendin' and strippin', baby
so don't be mad, nobody else trippin'
you seen a lot of crooks and them crooks still crook
you see, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
how to love, how to love, mm
see, you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
now you in this corner, tryna put it together
how to love, how to love, oh
see, i just want you to know
that you deserve the best, you're beautiful 
ayy
 
you're beautiful , yeah
and i want you to know
you're far from the usual 
ayy
 , far from the usual
you see, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
how to love, how to love, mm

Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

(You're gonna wish you never had met me) The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) The scars of your love, they leave me breathless

You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door (Ooh woah, oh)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (Woah)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Ooh woah, oh)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could've had it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could've had it all, yeah (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

And your feet flyin' up in the air

Don't,Ed Sheeran,8848,"I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her, ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'

Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's stayin' at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missin' it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissin' him, how I was confused about
Now, she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing

Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was cryin' on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (
Get lost
)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (
Get lost
)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were stayin' on the same **** hotel floor
And I wasn't lookin' for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singin'

Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started confessin'
And started undressin' and asked me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure, damn
She say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom, confusing me with questions like

Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fuck your girl, is it true?
You gettin' money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?

and i think i text her and told her i made it
and that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
and that's when i text her and told her i love her
then right after, texted and told her i'm faded

Party going wild, fist pumping
Music, I might lose it
Blast to the roof, that how we do'z it (do'z it do'z it)
I don't care the night, she don't care we like
Almost dared the right five
Ready to get live, ain't no surprise
Take me so high, jump and don't stop
Surfing the crowd ooh said I gotta be the man
When they heading my van, mic check one two
Shut them down in the club while the playboy does it, and y'all get lose lose
Out the bottle, we all get bent and again tomorrow
Gotta break loose cause that's the motto

Number one, club popper

Can't see me with ten binoculars, so cool
No doubt by the end of the night
Got the clothes coming off til I make that move
Somehow, someway, gotta raise the roof, roof
All black shades when the sun come through

Can't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go
Want you in my life","i still hear your voice when you sleep next to me
i still feel your touch in my dream
forgive me, my weakness, but i don't know why
without you, it's hard to survive

It's Friday night, and I feel alright
The party is here on the West Side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver, take the keys to my truck
Hit the 'shaw cause I'm faded
Honies in the street say, ""Monty, yo, we made it!""
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gangbangers forgot about the drive-by

To all my neighbors, you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (this is how we do it)

This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there

But now I'm a big G

Hundred-dollar bills, y'all

First Day Out,Tee Grizzley,8783,"(
Helluva made this beat, baby
)

These niggas prayed on my downfall (They what?)
These niggas prayed on my downfall (Who?)
On all ten, bitch, I stood tall (You did?)
Show these disloyal niggas how to ball

Go get a thermometer for the pot, I need this shit cooked right
Let's keep that water four hundred degrees Fahrenheit
You ever been inside a federal court room?
Nigga, you ever went to trial and fought for your life?
Bein' broke did somethin' to my spirit
Asked niggas to plug me, they act like they couldn't hear me
Look at me now, drivin' German engineering
You don't want your baby mama fucked, keep the ho from near me
Kilroy, 'member when I used to use your L's
To hit the road, hit the O and make them big boy sales?
Mu, 'member when you had them green things mailed?
With vacuum seals, tryin' not to have them green things smell?
Feds was on me, what you know about Related Through Money?
I don't know nothin', I just used to see 'em walk to the Coney
I fuck with bitches, my body count go from Pershing to Cody
Any further questions, you can take that up with the lawyer
My nigga Fenkell, J Money, Brightmo Lo, Project Joe
Will tell you every day before school I sold a half 'bow
How you think I won best dressed with no support?
And had them paid lawyers comin' in and out of court
Ayy, Dwan, though, ayy, Theo, ain't it a blessing?
We made it out Kentucky after all that happened?
After the pre-trials, after the status
After them impact statements, after the castle

Ayy, JR, nigga, ain't it a blessing?
We made it out of Lansing after all that happened? (We did that bitch, nigga)
After Michigan State, after Hubbard
When our mans told on us, them bands they took from us
Joy Road, bitch, but the money long as 6 Mile (Ah, ah, ah)
Brick Mile, knock your bitch down
Pick her up, knock her back down, pull her tracks out
Yes, I slap girl, yes, I slap dog, yes, I slap loud
Yes, I'll slap a pussy nigga if he act out (Fuck out of my face, nigga)
Yes, I caught cases on the road with them killers
Bro, kill me if I snitch 'cause if you snitch, I'm gon' kill you (Do it)
Spent a lot of time on that yard with them gorillas
Stood tall, did I let niggas ho me? Quit bein' silly
I know for a fact your bitch pussy get wet for a nigga (What's up?)
'Cause I do it better, plus I'm doin' better than niggas (What's up?)
I'm at home when I'm down there in Lexington, nigga
'Bout the king, they gon' drop you and who next to you, nigga (Go get 'em)
Unc said, ""Lil T, get ahead of them niggas""
When you take off, don't look back and try to rescue them niggas (I got you)
You killed his mans? Then make sure you get the rest of them niggas (I got 'em)
Don't let them get the best of you, just get the revenue, nigga (Let's get it)
So let me know what you can handle (You ready?), okay, come grab it (Pull up)
Here go some extras, so if I'm busy you can manage
Fiends had me Blade dancin', eating sixty dollar salads
Get it there and back, tell the feds I need a challenge
My first offer was thirty years, not a day lower (Nigga, what?)
I told them crackers holler at me when they sober
On parole, I'm a felon, you think I ain't got that blower?
Yeah, you right, bro, take his head off his fuckin' shoulders
(Boom-boom-boom)
You hear me? Hit the Rollie store with the Rollie on (Let's go)
What was our getaway car? A Jag' Portfolio (Get in, we out)
You hear me? Ayy, I heard I had some sneak dissers
Whoever feelin' hot, that AR got a heat sensor (Brreuh)
Cuz said, ""Don't entertain them hungry niggas""
I wish I would pay attention to these homeless niggas (Fuck them niggas)
Don't call my phone, I don't want to do no song with niggas (Who is this?)
And tell yo' bitch to tighten up before I bone her, nigga (I'm on my way)
I don't know you niggas, fuck wrong with niggas? (Who is them?)
Through these white buffs I can see the ho in niggas (That nigga pussy)
Free my nigga Parico, that boy be hoein' niggas (Free P)
Shoot the smile off your face, I don't joke with niggas (Nigga)
Boy, I can't trust you with that strap if you ain't got no bodies (What you doin' with that?)
Boy, I can't take you on no lick if you ain't robbed nobody (Drop dawg off)
You ain't no shooter, you can't do that shit without no molly
I came home and had the hoes wetter than Kalahari (Splash)
Thirty months ago, niggas ain't think that I was comin' home (Free them boys)
Shout out to them niggas' freaks that I been cummin' on
Get 'em to the crib, bust 'em down, now, bitch, run along (Said what you 'bout to do?)
This SK'll get to shakin' like there's somethin' wrong (Brrah)
Thirty bands two times, watch this money clone
The feds say my name hot like when the oven on
Bitch, I came home to my lil' brother gone
Niggas say they lookin' for me, pull up in the Skuddy zone
Who said I'm a snitch? You just heard a lie from him
Better check the black and white
That paperwork'll vouch for him
Zero toleration for that nigga, take his life from him
He don't want that pistol play? Okay, I'll Tyson him
I ain't hear from bitches when I had them blues on
So soon as I'm done fuckin', put your shoes on
I'm on parole in two states, I can't move wrong
The feds tryna build a case, I can't move wrong
I went to trial back to back, bitch, I'm 2-0 (I did)
State of Kentucky banned me from every jewelry store (I can't go in)
Say I can't even be in public with my hoodie on (Take that off)
Michigan State don't want him here, they don't know what he on

I know they prayed on my downfall (I already know that)

Numb,Linkin Park,8753,"I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Live Your Life (feat. Rihanna),T.I.,8654,"Miya hee, miya ho, miya hu, miya ha-ha
Miya hee, miya ho, miya hu, miya ha-ha
Miya hee, miya ho, miya hu, miya ha-ha
Miya hee, miya ho, miya hu, miya ha-ha

Ay... this a special what's happenin' to all my
All my soldiers over there in Iraq
E'rybody right here
What you need to do is be thankful for the life you got, y'knowmsayin?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got
Start bein' thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em baby girl, hey

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
(Rihanna, let's get it)
So live your life (AYY!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (OHH!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (AYY!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy
No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life (OHH!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy
'Cause I'm a paper chaser

Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH)
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin' my life

Hey, never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still, I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
(Rihanna, let's get it)
So live your life (AYY!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (OHH!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (AYY!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy
No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life (OHH!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy
'Cause I'm a paper chaser

Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH)
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin' my life

I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still I'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are

Got everybody watchin' what I do, come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin' awayyyyyyy
So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin' (shinin')
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin' the life, the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life, my life
I do it how I wanna do

Drunk On A Plane,Dierks Bentley,8635,"I took two weeks vacation for the honeymoon
A couple tickets all inclusive down in Cancun
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat 7A
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
I'm getting drunk on a plane

Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

We had this date marked on the calendar forever
We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together

Bad Intentions,Niykee Heaton,8614,"This is the face I wear treading the riptide
Abysmal oceans where good girls go to die
I wanna love somebody
Wanna feel their love on me
But after everything I still believe in true love
Not being able to find it
Damn, it tears me up
And I know it's my fault, I know it's my fault
Let's take a trip, ten thousand miles above the clouds
We can stay up here until we figure it out
I don't wanna go home
Don't wanna be alone, be alone

I got some damn bad intentions
I got some damn bad intentions
I got some secrets I forgot to mention
Haven't learned my lesson, woah-oh-oh
I got some damn bad intentions
I see the world in 25 dimensions
I've seen evil reign over perfection
Blood, heat, over tension
And I know, oh-woah-oh

You say you love the way the storms blow
But when it comes you close your window
You hate the fighting in the world
So you bring the battle home and fight until it's yours
Fight until I'm gone
And there's holes on the walls
Written in the sand
Deception on my lips and there's blood on your hands
And I'm tired of keepin' lies
You can see it in my eyes

Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties, getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish? I know I can be so selfish

Stereo Hearts (feat. Adam Levine) - feat. Adam Levine,Gym Class Heroes,8599,"My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no—
Oh—ote
Make me your radio (Yeah, ha)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you (Right there)
To sing along to my stereo (Gym Class Heroes, baby!)

If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like yikky-yeah check it, Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I’d sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you (Uh-ha-ha)

Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops? (Turn it up)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop (Peace)
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate (Never know)

I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you could hit it, sing along and take me by the hand

Bleeding Love,Leona Lewis,8533,"Hey

Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen, ooh
But somethin' happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground, found somethin' true
And everyone's lookin' 'round thinkin' I'm going crazy
Ooh, yeah

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'
You cut me open and I

Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleedin'
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Mm, yeah

Tryin' hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercin' sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from fallin', ooh, yeah
But nothin's greater than the rush that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'
You cut me open and I

Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleedin'
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open, mmh

And it's drainin' all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearin' these scars for everyone to see

I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth

Ooh, you cut me open and I

Keep bleedin'

Hey","hey
closed off from love, i didn't need the pain
once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen, ooh
but somethin' happened for the very first time with you
my heart melted to the ground, found somethin' true
and everyone's lookin' 'round thinkin' i'm going crazy
ooh, yeah
but i don't care what they say, i'm in love with you
they try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth

you cut me open
mm, yeah
tryin' hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
their piercin' sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
yet i know that their goal is to keep me from fallin', ooh, yeah
but nothin's greater than the rush that comes with your embrace
and in this world of loneliness, i see your face
yet everyone around me thinks that i'm going crazy
maybe, maybe
but i don't care what they say, i'm in love with you
they try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
my heart's crippled by the vein that i keep on closin'
you cut me open and i
keep bleedin'
keep, keep bleeding love
i keep bleedin'
i keep, keep bleeding love
keep bleedin'
keep, keep bleeding love
you cut me open, mmh
and it's drainin' all of me

Escape (The Pina Colada Song),Rupert Holmes,8474,"I was tired of my lady
We'd been together too long
Like a worn out recording
Of a favorite song
So while she lay there sleeping
I read the paper in bed
And in the personal columns
There was this letter I read

If you like piña coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga
If you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for
Write to me and escape

I didn't think about my lady
I know that sounds kind of mean
But me and my old lady
Had fallen into the same old dull routine
So I wrote to the paper
Took out a personal ad
And though I'm nobody's poet
I thought it wasn't half bad

Yes, I like piña coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food
I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon
And cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's
Where we'll plan our escape

So I waited with high hopes
And she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant
I knew the curve of her face
It was my own lovely lady
And she said, ""Aw, it's you""
Then we laughed for a moment
And I said, ""I never knew""

That you like piña coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
And the feel of the ocean
And the taste of champagne

In the dunes on the cape

A hundred jewels on throats
A hundred jewels between teeth
Now bring my boys in
Their skin in craters like the moon
The moon we love like a brother
While he glows through the room

Dancin' around the lies we tell
Dancin' around big eyes, as well
Even the comatose
They don't dance and tell

We live in cities you'll never see on-screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team

I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
So there

So all the cups got broke
Shards beneath our feet
But it wasn't my fault
And everyone's competing
For a love they won't receive
'Cause what this palace wants is release

We live in cities you'll never see on-screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team

I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
So there
I'm kind of older than I was when I reveled without a care

We're on each other's team
And you know, and you know, and you know","wait till you're announced
we've not yet lost all our graces
the hounds will stay in chains
look upon your greatness and she'll
send the call out, send the call out

Make You Feel My Love,Adele,8467,"When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love


The storms are raging on the rollin' sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love","when the rain is blowing in your face

Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.),Katy Perry,8448,"There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
This a hickey or a bruise?

Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked-out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

Last Friday night, yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots, think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night, yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night, we went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night, yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh-woah

But this Friday night
Do it all again
But this Friday night
Do it all again

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

Livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feel
Some people wanna kill their sorrow
Some people wanna fit in with the popular
That was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
Lookin' to make a vow soon
That ""I'ma get fucked up""
Fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute
And the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip
Then somebody said to me

""Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch""
First, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

If it do, then you're like me, makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of a bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh? Don't you feel bad? I prob'ly sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

Praying,Kesha,8445,"Well, you almost had me fooled

And we both know all the truth I could tell

Galway Girl,Ed Sheeran,8439,"She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""

I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand

My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

If ya got the feelin', jump up, touch the ceilin'
Muggs let the funk flow, someone's talkin' junk
Yo, I bust him in the eye and then I'll take the punk's ho

And just like the Prodigal Son, I've returned
Anyone steppin' to me, you'll get burned

If you come to battle, bring a shotgun (Shotgun)

Forgot About Dre,Dr. Dre,8395,"Y'all know me, still the same OG
But I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas
With no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me, 'cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office and back at my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze? Ho, please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-Gs
And the group that said, ""Motherfuck the police""
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all
If y'all don't like me, blow me
Y'all are gon' keep fuckin' around with me and turn me back to the old me

Nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

So what do you say to somebody you hate (What?)
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (Yup)
Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walkin' by
With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
Gave me an awkward eye ('Chu lookin' at?)
And strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs tryna walk it off
Fuck you too, bitch, call the cops
I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (Right here)
So from here on out, it's the Chronic II
Startin' today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady
Hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Callin' men ladies
Sorry Doc, but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him, Hailie (

'Cause I'm from the streets of

I told 'em all
All 'em little gangstas, who you think helped mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none
What, you think I sold 'em all
'Cause I stay well off?
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What, 'cause I been in the lab
With a pen and a pad tryin' to get this damn label off?
I ain't havin' that
This is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gon' be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque
And fuck rap, you can have it back

Flowers In Your Hair,The Lumineers,8379,"When we were younger we thought
Everyone was on our side
Then we grew a little bit
And romanticized
The time I saw
Flowers in your hair

See, it takes a boy to live
It takes a man to pretend he was there

So then we grew a little
And knew a lot
And how we demonstrated
It to the cops
And all the things we said
We were self-assured

'Cause it's a long road to wisdom
But it's a short one to bein' ignored

Be in my eyes
And be in my heart
Be in my eyes, aye, aye, aye
And be in my heart

So now I think that I could
Love you back
And I hope it's not too late
'Cause you're so attractive
And the way you move
I won't close my eyes

'Cause it takes a man to live
It takes a woman to make him compromise

Crazy Rap (Colt 45 & 2 Zig Zags),Afroman,8369,"Wait a minute, man, hey, check this out, man (Tell it)
It was this blind man, right? (This man) It was this blind man, right?
He was feelin' his way down the street with a stick, right? (Hey)
He walked past this fish market, you know what I'm sayin'?
(Fish market?) He stopped, he took a deep breath, he said
""Woo good morning ladies"" (Hahahahaha)
You like that shit, man? Hey man, I've got a gang of that shit, man
Hey, I'll tell you what, we'll all have a good time
We'll fool on the drum, and hey
Hey if everybody crowd around the mic'
I'll tell you all these motherfuckin' jokes I got
First I'm gonna start off like that, hey help me sing it, homeboy

Said Colt 45 and two Zig-Zags, baby, that's all we need
We can go to the park, after dark, smoke that tumbleweed
As the marijuana burn, we can take our turn
Singin' them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech & Chong
And sell tapes from here to Hong Kong
So roll, roll, roll my joint, pick out the seeds and stems
Feelin' high as hell, flyin' through Palmdale, skatin' on Dayton rims
So roll, roll, the '83 Cadillac Coupe DeVille
If my tapes and my CDs just don't sell, I bet my Caddy will

Well, it was just sundown in a small white town
They call it East Side Palmdale (Well)
When the Afroman walked through the white land
Houses went up for sale (Sale)
Well, I was standing on the corner sellin' rap CDs
When I met a little girl named Jan (Jan), I let her ride in my Caddy
'Cause I didn't know her daddy was the leader of the Ku Klux Klan
(Haha) We fucked on the bed, fucked on the floor (Woo)
Fucked so long I grew a fuckin' afro
Then I fucked to the left (Left), fucked to the right (Right)
She sucked my dick 'til the shit turned white (Haha)
Thought to myself, ""Sheeba-sheeba"", got my ass lookin' like a zebra
I put on my clothes and I was on my way
Until her daddy pulled up in a Chevrolet (Oh)
So I ran, I jumped out the back window
But her daddy, he was waitin' with a two-by-four
Oh (Haha), he beat me to the left, he beat me to the right
The motherfucker whooped my ass all night
But I ain't mad at her prejudiced dad
That's the best damn pussy I ever had (Haha)
Got a bag of weed and a bottle of wine (Woo)
I'm gonna fuck that bitch just one more time

Colt 45 and two Zig-Zags, baby, that's all we need (Come on)
We can go to the park, after dark, smoke that tumbleweed
And as the marijuana burn, we can take our turn
Singin' them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech & Chong
And sell tapes from here to Hong Kong

If my tapes and my CDs just don't sell, I bet my Caddy will

I met this lady in Hollywood
She had green hair, but damn she looked good
I took her to my house because she was fine
But she whooped out a dick that was bigger than mine
I met this lady from Japan, never made love with an African
I fucked her once, I fucked her twice
I ate that pussy like shrimp-fried rice
Don't be amazed at the stories I tell ya (Tell ya)
I met a woman in the heart of Australia
Had a big butt and big titties too
So I hopped in her ass like a Kangaroo
See, I met this woman from Hawaii
Stuck it in her ass and she said ""AIEE!""
Lips was breakfast, pussy was lunch
Then her titties busted open with Hawaiian Punch
I met Colonel Sanders' wife in the state of Kentucky
She said, ""I'd fry some chicken if you'd just fuck me""
I came in her mouth, it was a crisis
I gave her my secret blend of Herbs 'n' Spices

Colt 45 and two Zig-Zags, baby, that's all we need (Uh)
We can go to the park, after dark, smoke that tumbleweed (Uh)
And as the marijuana burn, we can take our turn

Stop and hit the bong like Cheech & Chong
(Ay, wait a minute man, check this out man, ayy ha)
And sell tapes from here to Hong Kong

I met Dolly Parton in Tennessee
Her titties were filled with Hennessy
That country music really drove me crazy
But I rode that ass and said, ""Yes, Miss Daisy""
Met this lady in Oklahoma, put that pussy in a coma
Met this lady in Michigan, I can't wait 'til I fuck that bitch again
Met a real black girl down in South Carolina
Fucked her until she turned into a white albino
Fucked this hooker in Iowa, I fucked her on credit, so I owe her
(Haha) Fucked this girl down in Georgia
Came in her mouth, man, I thought I told ya?
Met this beautiful sexy ho
She just ran across the border of Mexico
Fine young thing said her name's Maria
I wrapped her up just like a hot tortilla
I wanna get married, but I can't afford it
I know I'ma cry when she get deported

Have you ever went over a girl's house to fuck
But the pussy just ain't no good? (Say what?)
I mean, you gettin' upset because you can't get her wet
Plus you in the wrong neighborhood
So you try to play it off and eat the pussy
But it take her so long to cum
Then a dude walk in, that's her big boyfriend
And he asks you, ""Where you from?""
So you wipe your mouth and you try to explain
You start talking real fast
But he already mad 'cause you fucking his woman
So he start beating on yo' ass, now your clothes all muddy
Your nose all bloody, your dick was hard but now it's soft
You thought you had a girl to rock your world

Keep coming up with funky ass shit like every single day
May I, kick a little something for the G's? (yeah)
And make a few ends as (yeah!) I breeze through
2 in the morning and the party's still jumping
Cause my momma ain't home
I got bitches in the living room getting it on
And they ain't leaving til 6 in the morning
So what you wanna do? Sheeeit
I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But (but what) we don't love them hoes, yea
So we gonna smoke a ounce to this
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckas bounce to this

Just rollin'! (I'm on a mission on the grind)
Just rollin'! (Homies get cought up, doin' time)
Just rollin'! (What?) (laid back)

You got to get yours but fool I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listening to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be the homeboy's lady (Oh, that bitch)
80 degrees, when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-T's, cause you gets none of these, at ease
As I mob with the Dogg Pound, feel the breeze
Beyotch I'm just


Later on that day
My homey Dr. Dre came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic that made me choke
Shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic: yeah I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stopping, I'm still popping
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me; not with a cherry on top
Cause when I bust my nut I'm raising up off the cot
Don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you hoes, I'm out the door
And I'll be

My head is an animal
And once, there was an animal
It had a son that mowed the lawn
The son was an okay guy
They had a pet dragonfly
The dragonfly, it ran away
But it came back with a story to say


Her dirty paws and furry coat
She ran down the forest slopes
The forest of talking trees
They used to sing about the birds and the bees
The bees had declared a war
The sky wasn't big enough for them all
The birds, they got help from below
From dirty paws and the creatures of snow

They were scared down in their holes

Was colored black by those killing machines

Beware,Big Sean,8245,"When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

Yeah, praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back
Looking at my phone like she finna call back
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
'Cause by now, she woulda sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take it all back
Saying ""Fuck you,"" ""I miss you,"" or ""I hate you so much""
'Cause girls only say ""hate you"" to the guys that they love
I know, I know, I know
The highs, the lows it comes, it goes
You say ""Be real,"" I try, I don't
'Cause you take anything and just make it everything (God)
Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring, funny, right?
And I never cheated; I mean, maybe once or twice
But one time don't change everything
She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same
She's still insane and now she's saying

I drank too much, please call me a cabby (Swerve)
Penthouse afterparty, hoes want the addy (Swerve)
Fuck, they can ride with us, crawl in the Caddy
Third row, that's when you call, I hit cancel
Really, I hit answer, fuck, I hate when that happens
Phone in my pocket for the whole night
And you heard bitches screaming 'til my phone died
Then she text me like, ""Why you still talk to my mama?
How the fuck you run around with condoms?
Why you make me get this tattoo? Man, fuck this tattoo
You the reason I wasn't single in college
What, all because I had you?

No Church In The Wild,JAY Z,8238,"Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer
Who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive?
Alright, alright
No church in the wild

Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Colosseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rolling in the Rolls-Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hiding from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I'm wondering if a thug's prayers reach
Is Pius pious 'cause God loves pious?
Socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek?
All for Plato, screech
I'm out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy laid beats

Coke on her Black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there's permission
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil

Sun coming up, 5 a.m

I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos, one read, ""No apologies""
The other said, ""Love is cursed by monogamy""
That's something that the pastor don't preach
That's something that a teacher can't teach
When we die, the money, we can't keep

Where Is The Love?,The Black Eyed Peas,8222,"What's wrong with the world, Mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryna stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

Children hurt, and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?

(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong
With this world that we livin' in? People keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love

All Summer Long,Kid Rock,8215,"It was 1989, my thoughts were short, my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man, I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long

Catching walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks

Year 3000,Jonas Brothers,8147,"One day, when I came home at lunchtime
I heard a funny noise
Went out to the backyard to find out
If it was one of those rowdy boys
Stood there with my neighbor called Peter
And a Flux Capacitor

He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah

He said, ""I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine""

He took me to the future in the flux thing
And I saw everything
Boy bands, and another one, and another one
And another one

Slashed a hole in all four tires

And I've been a fool and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way

He said, ""Think about what you saying, 'Fuck niggas'
No better than Samuel on Django

Sound like I needed some soul searchin'
My pops gave me some game in real person
Retraced my steps on what they never taught me
Did my homework fast before government caught me
So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us
So many artists gave her an explanation to hole us
Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
N-E-G-U-S, definition: royalty, king royalty, wait, listen
N-E-G-U-S, description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish
The history books overlooked the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies don't recognize we been usin' it wrong
So I'ma break it down and put my game in a song
N-E-G-U-S, say it with me, or say it no more
Black stars can come and get me
Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she right on time

Hurricane,Luke Combs,8080,"Hadn't had a good time since you know when

Baby, without warning

Knew it was gonna be a long night

We locked eyes over whiskey on ice

I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right

Light the bonfire, then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack 'n' Jim were a few good men
Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said, she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know
Man that talk is getting old
Ya better mind your business, man, watch your mouth

Down to my hood, back in them woods
We do it different 'round here, that's right
But we sure do it good and we do it all night

Ice, ice, baby
Ice, ice, baby

All right, stop, collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs ahold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
""Will it ever stop?"" Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights, and I'll glow
To the extreme, I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
Dance, go rush the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly, when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it, you better gangway
You better hit bullseye, the kid don't play
If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby

Now that the party is jumpin'
With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point, no fakin'
Cookin' MCs like a pound of bacon
Burnin' 'em if you ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll, it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5.0
With the ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby, wavin' just to say hi
""Did you stop?"" No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuin' to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm headin' to the next block
The block was dead, yo, so I continued to
A1A Beachfront Avenue
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a 9
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're full of eight ball
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my 9, all I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper, the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene, you know what I mean?
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla

Take heed 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
These are rhymes you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step
With this, Shay plays on the fade
Slice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade
So fast, other DJs say, ""Damn!""
If rhyme was a drug, I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while Deshay revolves it

enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'cause my style's like a chemical spill
these are rhymes you can vision and feel
conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
we make it hype and you want to step
with this, shay plays on the fade
slice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade
so fast, other djs say, ""damn!""
if rhyme was a drug, i'd sell it by the gram
keep my composure when it's time to get loose
magnetized by the mic while i kick my juice
if there was a problem yo i'll solve it
check out the hook while deshay revolves it
ice, ice, baby
vanilla ice, ice, baby

word to your mother

Your Body Is a Wonderland,John Mayer,8012,"We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me, discovering you
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

And if you want love we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland

Something 'bout the way
Your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when
Crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go
And though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

You want love, we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland

Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see RiRi right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
Views
 already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially

They gotta go, they gotta go
They gotta die out eventually

i don't take this shit for granted
i do my own propaganda
i feel like juelz santana
leg hangin' out the phantom
6 cold like alaska
views
already a classic
roy outta here like nasa
bustin' 1's out the plastic
her gram too poppin' to fuck her
the chain too heavy to tuck it, i'm serious
i feed my family with this
so don't play with my money this summer, i'm serious
i don't run out of material
you shouldn't speak on me, period
you try to give 'em your side of the story
they heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
they feeling a way and won't hide it
niggas done being silent
don't get along man, we tried it
what's the point of even tryin'?
i hate a goofy especially
they always dyin' to mention me
they gotta go, they gotta go
they gotta die out eventually
i cannot give 'em no empathy
i'ma have b's when i'm 70
they cannot fuck with the legacy
i don't know what else is left for me
after this no one a threat to me
my enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
i don't let it get to me
done
look what i've done in my life
i had to count it and count it again
to make sure the money was right
they love to talk
me, i'm just dunning the hype
me, i'm just dunning the hype
me i'm just done, done, done, done, done"

Crooked Smile,J. Cole,7963,"[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & 
Jennifer Hudson

Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

They tell me I should fix my grill 'cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how
My shit is crooked—look at how far I done got without it!
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you a woman I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can't face what's wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on
Your roommate yelling, ""Why you gotta take so long?!""
What it's like to have a crooked smile

On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (This crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round (Yeah)

To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim 'cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful, you can't be sure
'Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin'
So all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin'
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care
'Cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see
That the hands can't touch, that them broads can't be
And that's you, never let 'em see your frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I'll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain't laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile

Back round
, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase 'em
Look at the nation
That's a crooked smile braces couldn't even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, 'cause we in Hell already
I ask: If my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let's make a mil'
Hey officer man, we don't want nobody gettin' killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail
I got money for the bail now, and well now
If you askin' will I tell now—ayy, hell nah
I ain't snitchin' 'cause, man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around then you wouldn't need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?

seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
wonder why we inhale, 'cause we in hell already
i ask if my skin pale, would i then sell like eminem or adele?
but one more time for the 'ville
and fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let's make a mil'
hey officer man, we don't want nobody gettin' killed
just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail
i got money for the bail now, and well now
if you askin' will i tell now ayy, hell nah
i ain't snitchin' 'cause, man, they get them niggas stitches now
if you was around then you wouldn't need a witness now

Secrets,OneRepublic,7963,"I need another story
Something to get off my chest
My life gets kinda boring
Need something that I can confess
'Til all my sleeves are stained red
From all the truth that I've said
Come by it honestly I swear
Thought you saw me wink, no
I've been on the brink, so

Tell me what you want to hear
Something that will light those ears
I'm sick of all the insincere
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away

Don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics ever jump in line

It's like we're chasing all those stars
Who's driving shiny big black cars
And every day I see the news
All the problems that we could solve
And when a situation rises
Just write it into an album
Send it straight to gold

When We Were Young,Adele,7924,"Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true
But, if by chance, you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie, you sound like a song
My God, this reminds me of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie, it was just like a song

I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me

You still look like a movie, you still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie, it was just like a song

(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)

It's hard to admit that (When we were young)
Everything just takes me back (When we were young)
To when you were there (When we were young)
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on (When we were young)
Just in case it hasn't gone (When we were young)
I guess I still care (When we were young)
Do you still care?

It was just like a movie, it was just like a song
My God, this reminds me of when we were young
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)

Let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time
(When we were young, when we were young)
That we might be exactly like we were before we realised
(When we were young, when we were young)
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
(When we were young, when we were young)
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old, it makes me reckless
(When we were young, when we were young)
It was just like a movie, it was just like a song
When we were young","everybody loves the things you do
from the way you talk to the way you move
everybody here is watching you
'cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true
but, if by chance, you're here alone
can i have a moment before i go?
'cause i've been by myself all night long
hoping you're someone i used to know
you look like a movie, you sound like a song
my god, this reminds me of when we were young
let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time
that we might be exactly like we were before we realised
we were sad of getting old, it made us restless
it was just like a movie, it was just like a song
i was so scared to face my fears
nobody told me that you'd be here
and i swear you'd moved overseas
that's what you said when you left me
you still look like a movie, you still sound like a song
my god, this reminds me of when we were young
let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time
that we might be exactly like we were before we realised
we were sad of getting old, it made us restless
it was just like a movie, it was just like a song
 when we were young 
 when we were young 
 when we were young 
 when we were young 
it's hard to admit that when we were young 
everything just takes me back when we were young 
to when you were there when we were young 
to when you were there
and a part of me keeps holding on when we were young 
just in case it hasn't gone when we were young

do you still care?
it was just like a movie, it was just like a song
