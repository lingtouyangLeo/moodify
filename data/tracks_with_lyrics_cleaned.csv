dostum.. haklısın
hmm, şuradaki sağlam orospuları görüyor musun?
vay, evet
şu ağaçları görüyor musun? peki ya şu suyu?
sanırım sorun falan yok
hadi ama kardeşim, şükretmen gereken çok şey var
aga.. düşündüm de.. haklısın
çok haklısın ki çok haklıyım. çok haksız olduğum bir gün bile hatırlamıyorum
sağol lil boat, dostum
kanka, bu yüzden buradayım
son zamanlarda kafayı bulmuyordum...
pekala, belki biraz bebeğim, yalan söylemek istemiyorum
bana mesaj attığında, kızım, her zaman cevap vermiyorum biliyorum
sen bir melek değilsin, uçamıyorsun bile
fark ediyorum ki, bir şeyler bildiğini sanıyorsun
tüm bu hayaletler bana doğru geliyor, kimin fırlattığını merak ediyorum
vizyonu göremiyorlar, dostum dikkatlari dağılmış olmalı
bu gerçekten güzel bir albüm ahbap, kim yazdı merak ediyorum, oh lanet olsun
tamam, o zencilerin gitmesini diliyorum
cirque du soleil gibi her zaman etrafta palyaçolar var
bu bir albüm değil, hatta bunlar sadece gelişi güzeller
bu şey çok soğuk, piyasaya sürüldüğünde kar günü olacak
ayy, o iyi ve bunu biliyor, söylemiyor, sadece gösteriyor
ben tıpkı derozan gibiyim, shoot atarsam girer
cali'de güneşleniyorum, onlar o kadar ıslanıyor ki kızağa ihtiyaçları var
oprah ile selfie'im var, sadece paylaşasım yok
mutlu mekanımda takılıyorum, 2006' dan beri somurtmuyorum
2001' den beri ağlamıyorum, benim mekanım six flags gibi ve senin evin
hiç eğlenceli değil
benimkine geri de gelebilirsin, arkadaşın tatlı değil
fakat sorun değil
yüksek notada bitireceğiz
küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
elde edebileceğim bir kız çünkü çok fazla beğeni almıyor
kıvırcık tatlı bir kız, karım olabilir
dur, bu hep, sonsuzluk anlamına geliyor, bekle, boş ver
oh, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
elde edebileceğim bir kız çünkü çok fazla beğeni almıyor

oh, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
gözlüyorum, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
oh ben...
21 yaşında olduğunu söylüyor, kimlik görmem gerek
bütün orospularım çift çift geliyor aşağıdaki taşaklarım gibi
bir hatchback'te şehri turladığım günleri hatırlıyorum
genç goblinlerimle bir sorun arıyoruz
modelimi evine boynundaki ağrılarla gönderiyorum
o kadar çok para kazandım ki durdurulamıyor
kardeşlerim soyadım gibi yanımdadır
herkese evcilleşmeyeceğimi söylediğim zamanlar aklımda
woah, altı ay sonra ters döndüm ve şimdi oyundayım
sahte zincir kolyelerden bambaşka seviyelerde elmaslar
""beni buradan alabilir misiniz?"" sveiyesinden buraya geldim
beni siklemeyen bir sürü insanı hatırlıyorum
üniversiteye gittiler, şimdi hepsi tarih oldu
dişimdeki altını elmasa dönüştürdüm
arabamızda sert takılıyoruz, gizemli şeyler peşindeyiz (raggy!)
beni siklememeye devam et
uzun zamandır lüks içinde yaşıyorum, hayır
boat ve kyle piyano tuşları gibi birbirinden ayrılmaz
anneannemin üstüne yemin ederim ki asla bir orospuyu kondomsuz sikmem
küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
elde edebileceğim bir kız çünkü çok fazla beğeni almıyor
kıvırcık tatlı bir kız, karım olabilir

sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bam-bam
ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe (eh-eh; ¡plo!)
quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
empezamos lento, después salvaje
pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza, oye (yeah, yo)

Lean On (feat. MØ & DJ Snake),Major Lazer,27088,"क्या आपको याद है, कुछ समय पहले
हम फुटपाथ पर चलते थे?
हम मासूम थे, याद है?
हमने बस एक-दूसरे का ख्याल रखा है
लेकिन रात गर्म थी
हम साहसी और जवान थे
चारों ओर, हवा चल रही है
हम एक-दूसरे को जाने देने के लिए थामे रहेंगे
एक चुम्मा उड़ाओ, बंदूक चलाओ
हमें किसी का सहारा चाहिए
एक चुम्मा उड़ाओ, बंदूक चलाओ
हमें बस किसी के सहारे की जरूरत है
एक चुम्मा उड़ाओ, बंदूक चलाओ
हमें किसी का सहारा चाहिए
एक चुम्मा उड़ाओ, बंदूक चलाओ
ह-ह-हमें बस किसी के सहारे की जरूरत है
(हे, हे, हे, हे)
(हे, हे, हे, हे)
जब हम बूढ़े हो जायेंगे तो हम क्या करेंगे?
क्या हम उसी रास्ते पर चलेंगे?
तब तुम क्या वहाँ मेरा साथ दोगे?
लहरों के पलटने पर भी मजबूती से बने रहेंगे
जब रातें लंबी होती हैं
तुम्हारे घर आने की चाहत होती है
चारों ओर, हवा चल रही है
हम एक-दूसरे को जाने देने के लिए थामे रहेंगे
एक चुम्मा उड़ाओ, बंदूक चलाओ
हमें किसी का सहारा चाहिए
एक चुम्मा उड़ाओ, बंदूक चलाओ
हमें बस किसी के सहारे की जरूरत है (हे)
एक चुम्मा उड़ाओ, बंदूक चलाओ
हमें किसी का सहारा चाहिए
एक चुम्मा उड़ाओ, बंदूक चलाओ
ह-ह-हमें बस किसी के सहारे की जरूरत है
हमें बस किसी के सहारे की जरूरत है
(हमें किसी का सहारा चाहिए, हे)
(हे, हे)
ह-ह-हमें बस किसी के सहारे की जरूरत है
(मेजर लेज़र, हे)
ओह, ओह-ओह
(हे, हे, हे, हे)
(हे, हे, हे, हे, हे)
एक चुम्मा उड़ाओ, बंदूक चलाओ (हे, हे)

their shadows searchin' in the night
streetlight people
livin' just to find emotion
hidin' somewhere in the night
workin' hard to get my fill
everybody wants a thrill
payin' anything to roll the dice
just one more time
some will win, some will lose
some are born to sing the blues

1-800-273-8255,Logic,26176,"i've been on the low, i been taking my time
i feel like i'm out of my mind
it feel like my life ain't mine (who can relate? woo)
i've been on the low, i been taking my time
i feel like i'm out of my mind
it feel like my life ain't mine
i don't wanna be alive, i don't wanna be alive
i just wanna die today, i just wanna die
i don't wanna be alive, i don't wanna be alive
i just wanna die
and let me tell you why
all this other shit i'm talkin' 'bout, they think they know it
i've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
and my life don't even matter, i know it, i know it
i know i'm hurting deep down, but can't show it
i never had a place to call my own
i never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
where you been? where you at? what's on your mind?
they say every life precious but nobody care about mine
i've been on the low, i been taking my time
i feel like i'm out of my mind
it feel like my life ain't mine (who can relate? woo)
i've been on the low, i been taking my time
i feel like i'm out of my mind
it feel like my life ain't mine
i want you to be alive, i want you to be alive
you don't gotta die today, you don't gotta die
i want you to be alive, i want you to be alive
you don't gotta die, now let me tell you why
it's the very first breath when your head's been drowning underwater
and it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest-to-chest with a lover
it's holding on, though the road's long, seeing light in the darkest things
and when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is
i know that you'll thank god you did
i know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
i know you're the reason i believe in life
what's the day without a little night?
i'm just tryna shed a little light
it can be hard
it can be so hard
but you gotta live right now
you got everything to give right now
i've been on the low, i been taking my time
i feel like i'm out of my mind
it feel like my life ain't mine (who can relate? woo)
i've been on the low, i been taking my time
i feel like i'm out of my mind
it feel like my life ain't mine
i finally wanna be alive, i finally wanna be alive
i don't wanna die today, i don't wanna die
i finally wanna be alive, i finally wanna be alive
i don't wanna die, i don't wanna die
pain don't hurt the same, i know
the lane i travel feels alone
but i'm moving 'til my legs give out
and i see my tears melt in the snow
but i don't wanna cry, i don't wanna cry anymore
i wanna feel alive, i don't even wanna die anymore
oh, i don't wanna
i don't wanna
i don't even wanna die anymore"
Sorry,Justin Bieber,26155,"you gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty

and by once or twice, i mean maybe a couple of hundred times
so let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight

can we both say the words and forget this?
yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?

Thinking Out Loud,Ed Sheeran,25110,"when your legs don't work like they used to before
and i can't sweep you off of your feet
will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
and darlin', i will be lovin' you till we're seventy
and baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
and i'm thinkin' 'bout how
people fall in love in mysterious ways
maybe just the touch of a hand
well, me, i fall in love with you every single day
and i just wanna tell you i am
so honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms
kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
and place your head on my beatin' heart, i'm thinkin' out loud
maybe we found love right where we are
when my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
and the crowds don't remember my name
when my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
i know you will still love me the same
'cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
and baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
i'm thinkin' 'bout how
people fall in love in mysterious ways
and maybe it's all part of a plan
oh, i'll just keep on makin' the same mistakes
hoping that you'll understand
that, baby, now, take me into your lovin' arms
kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
place your head on my beatin' heart, i'm thinkin' out loud
and maybe we found love right where we are, oh-oh
lo-lo-lo, lo-lo-lo
lo-lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, love
so baby, now, take me into your lovin' arms
and kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, oh, darlin'
place your head on my beatin' heart, i'm thinkin' out loud

we in here like rogaine

and as far as i can see, i just need privacy
plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty
i just need space to do me, give the world what they're tryna see
a stella maxwell right beside of me
a ferrari, i'm buyin' three
a closet of saint laurent, get what i want when i want
'cause this hunger is drivin' me, yeah
i just need to be alone, i just need to be at home
understand what i'm speakin' on, if time is money i need a loan

it changes though, now that i'm famous
everyone knows how this lifestyle is dangerous
but i love it, the rush is amazin'
celebrate nightly and everyone rages
i found how to cope with my angers
i'm swimmin' in money
swimmin' in liquor, my liver is muddy
but it's all good, i'm still sippin' this bubbly
this shit is lovely
this shit ain't random, i didn't get lucky
made it right here 'cause i'm sick with it, cuddy

Body Like A Back Road,Sam Hunt,22506,"got a girl from the southside, got braids in her hair
first time i seen her walk by, man i 'bout fell up out my chair
had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
now me and her go way back like cadillac seats
body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
i know every curve like the back of my hand
doin' fifteen in a thirty, i ain't in no hurry
i'ma take it slow just as fast as i can
the way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
but i can turn them inside out, i don't need no help
got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet, man
and ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets
body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
i know every curve like the back of my hand
doin' fifteen in a thirty, i ain't in no hurry
i'ma take it slow just as fast as i can
we're out here in the boondocks with the breeze and the birds
tangled up in the tall grass with my lips on hers
on a highway to heaven, headed south of her smile, mmm
get there when we get there, every inch is a mile
body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
i know every curve like the back of my hand
doin' fifteen in a thirty, i ain't in no hurry
i'ma take it slow just as fast as i can
i'ma take it slow

Say You Won't Let Go,James Arthur,22445,"i met you in the dark, you lit me up
you made me feel as though i was enough
we danced the night away, we drank too much
i held your hair back when you were throwin' up
then you smiled over your shoulder
for a minute, i was stone-cold sober
i pulled you closer to my chest
and you asked me to stay over
i said, ""i already told ya
i think that you should get some rest""
i knew i loved you then, but you'd never know
'cause i played it cool when i was scared of letting go
i knew i needed you, but i never showed
but i wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
just say you won't let go
just say you won't let go
i'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
i'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
and i'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
and i'll thank my lucky stars for that night
when you looked over your shoulder
for a minute, i'll forget that i'm older
i wanna dance with you right now, woah
and you look as beautiful as ever
and i swear that every day, you'll get better
you make me feel this way somehow
i'm so in love with you, and i hope you know
darlin', your love is more than worth its weight in gold
we've come so far, my dear, look how we've grown
and i wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
just say you won't let go
just say you won't let go
i wanna live with you even when we're ghosts
'cause you were always there for me when i needed you most
i'm gonna love you till my lungs give out
i promise till death we part, like in our vows
so i wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
that it's just you and me till we're grey and old
just say you won't let go
just say you won't let go
just say you won't let go
oh, just say you won't let go"

Love Yourself,Justin Bieber,22207,"for all the times that you rained on my parade
and all the clubs you get in using my name
you think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
you think i'm cryin' on my own, well, i ain't
and i didn't wanna write a song
'cause i didn't want anyone thinking i still care
i don't, but you still hit my phone up
and baby, i'll be movin' on
and i think you should be somethin' i don't wanna hold back
maybe you should know that
my mama don't like you and she likes everyone
and i never like to admit that i was wrong
and i've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
but now i know, i'm better sleeping on my own
'cause if you like the way you look that much
oh baby, you should go and love yourself
and if you think that i'm still holdin' on to somethin'
you should go and love yourself
but when you told me that you hated my friends
the only problem was with you and not them
and every time you told me my opinion was wrong
and tried to make me forget where i came from
and i didn't wanna write a song
'cause i didn't want anyone thinking i still care
i don't, but you still hit my phone up
and baby, i'll be movin' on

oh baby, you should go and love yourself
and if you think that i'm still holdin' on to somethin'
you should go and love yourself
for all the times that you made me feel small
i fell in love, now i feel nothin' at all
i never felt so low and i was vulnerable
was i a fool to let you break down my walls?
'cause if you like the way you look that much
oh baby, you should go and love yourself
and if you think that i'm still holdin' on to somethin'
you should go and love yourself
'cause if you like the way you look that much

if pirus and crips all got along
they'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
seem like the whole city go against me
every time i'm in the street, i hear, ""yawk, yawk, yawk, yawk""
man down, where you from, nigga?
fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
this m.a.a.d city i run, my nigga
brace yourself, i'll take you on a trip down memory lane
this is not a rap on how i'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
this is cul-de-sac and plenty cognac and major pain
not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
it was me, l boog, and yan yan, yg lucky ride down rosecrans
it got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window — check yourself
uh, warriors and conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
with society, the driver seat, the first one to get killed
seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
at the same burger stand where **** hang out
now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
but ever since that day, i was lookin' at him different
that was back when i was nine, joey packed the nine
pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
pack a van with four guns at a time
with the sliding door, fuck is up?
fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
suck a dick or die or sucker punch
a wall of bullets comin' from ak's, ar's, ""ayy, y'all, duck""
that's what mama said when we was eatin' that free lunch
aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
you killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce
now crawl your head in that noose
you wind up dead on the news
ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' bgs up to pre-approve
bodies on top of bodies, ivs on top of ivs
obviously the coroner between the sheets like the isleys
when you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
make sure you're corporate, or they'll be callin' your mother collect
they say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
when we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
you movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a tec
go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, i guess
​m.a.a.d. city

hood ('sup, cuz?)
it ain't nothin' but a compton thang
g-yeah, how we do
fresh outta school 'cause i was a high school grad'
sleepin' in the livin' room of my mama's pad
reality struck, i seen the white car crash
hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed (watch out, cuz)
my pops said i needed a job, i thought i believed him
security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
in fact, i got fired 'cause i was inspired by all of my friends
to stage a robbery, the third saturday i clocked in
projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up (sup?)
cocaine laced in marijuana
and they wonder why i rarely smoke now
imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
i was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
i made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
you know the reasons, but still'll never know my life

g-yeah, cocaine, weed

sherm sticks, butt-nakeds

cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
one time's crooked and shit
block a nigga in
alondra, rosecrans, bullis, it's compton
i'm still in the hood, loc, g-yeah, that's cool
shit, the hood took me under, so i follow the rules
but, g-yeah, that's like me, i grew up in the hood where they bang
and niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
pass it to the left, so i can smoke on me
a couple drive-bys in the hood lately, g-yeah
couple of iv's with the fuckin' spray-can
shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
crew i'm finna slay, the street life i crave
shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
mount up, regulators in the whip
down the boulevard with the pistol grip, g-yeah
trip, we in the hood still
so, loc, grab a strap 'cause, g-yeah, it's so real, g-yeah
deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
and a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand
if i told you i killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
perceive me to be innocent kendrick you seen in the street
with a basketball and some now and laters to eat?
if i mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
and it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
with dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
kill 'em all if they gossip
the children of the corn, they vandalizin' the option
of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
constantly drinkin' and drive
hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
probably go to the projects

made me an angel on angel dust, what?

Take Me To Church,Hozier,19918,"my lover's got humour
she's the giggle at a funeral
knows everybody's disapproval
i should've worshipped her sooner
if the heavens ever did speak
she's the last true mouthpiece
every sunday's gettin' more bleak
a fresh poison each week
we were born sick, you heard them say it
my church offers no absolutes
she tells me, ""worship in the bedroom""
the only heaven i'll be sent to
is when i'm alone with you
i was born sick, but i love it
command me to be well
a, amen
amen, amen
take me to church
i'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
i'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that deathless death
oh, good god, let me give you my life
take me to church
i'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
i'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that deathless death
oh, good god, let me give you my life
if i'm a pagan of the good times
my lover's the sunlight
to keep the goddess on my side
she demands a sacrifice
drain the whole sea, get somethin' shiny
somethin' meaty for the main course
that's a fine lookin' high horse
what you got in the stable?
we've a lot of starvin' faithful
that looks tasty, that looks plenty
this is hungry work
take me to church
i'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
i'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
offer me my deathless death
oh, good god, let me give you my life
take me to church
i'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
i'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
offer me my deathless death
oh, good god, let me give you my life
no masters or kings when the ritual begins
there is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
in the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
only then, i am human, only then, i am clean
oh, oh, amen
amen, amen
take me to church
i'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
i'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that deathless death

to teeth and claws and slammin' doors at you
if this is all we're livin' for
why are we doin' it, doin' it, doin' it anymore?

when we're becomin' somethin' else, i think it's time to walk away

everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
why don't you be you, and i'll be me?

tryna fit your hand inside of mine when we know it just don't belong
there's no force on earth could make it feel right, no, woah
tryna push this problem up the hill when it's just too heavy to hold
i think now's the time to let it slide

i hate that i love you
don't want to, but i can't put
nobody else above you
i hate you, i love you
i hate that i want you
you want her, you need her
and i'll never be her
i miss you when i can't sleep
or right after coffee or right when i can't eat
i miss you in my front seat
still got sand in my sweaters
from nights we don't remember
do you miss me like i miss you?
fucked around and got attached to you
friends can break your heart, too
and i'm always tired, but never of you
if i pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that
i put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that
i type a text, but thеn i never mind that
i got thesе feelings, but you never mind that
oh oh, keep it on the low
you're still in love with me, but your friends don't know
if you wanted me, you would just say so
and if i were you, i would never let me go
i hate you, i love you
i hate that i love you
don't want to, but i can't put
nobody else above you
i hate you, i love you
i hate that i want you
you want her, you need her
and i'll never be her
i don't mean no harm, i just miss you on my arm
wedding bells were just alarms
caution tape around my heart
you ever wonder what we could have been?
you said you wouldn't and you did
lie to me, lie with me, get your fix
now all my drinks and all my feelings are all mixed
always missing people that i shouldn't be missing
sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
i know that i control my thoughts and i should stop reminiscing
but i learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
when love and trust are gone
i guess this is moving on
everyone i do right does me wrong
so every lonely night, i sing this song
i hate you, i love you
i hate that i love you
don't want to, but i can't put
nobody else above you
i hate you, i love you
i hate that i want you
you want her, you need her
and i'll never be her
i hate you, i love you
i hate that i love you
don't want to, but i can't put

7 Years,Lukas Graham,18735,"once, i was seven years old, my mama told me
""go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely""
once, i was seven years old
it was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
pushing each other to the limits, we were learnin' quicker
by eleven, smokin' herb and drinkin' burnin' liquor
never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure
once, i was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely""
once, i was eleven years old
i always had that dream like my daddy before me
so i started writin' songs, i started writin' stories
something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'cause only those i really love will ever really know me
once, i was twenty years old, my story got told
before the mornin' sun, when life was lonely
once, i was twenty years old (lukas graham!)
i only see my goals, i don't believe in failure
'cause i know the smallest voices, they can make it major
i got my boys with me, at least those in favor
and if we don't meet before i leave, i hope i'll see you later
once, i was twenty years old, my story got told
i was writin' 'bout everything i saw before me
once, i was twenty years old
soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
we've traveled around the world and we're still roamin'
soon, we'll be thirty years old
i'm still learnin' about life, my woman brought children for me
so i can sing them all my songs and i can tell them stories
most of my boys are with me, some are still out seekin' glory
and some i had to leave behind, my brother, i'm still sorry
soon, i'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
remember life and then your life becomes a better one
i made a man so happy when i wrote a letter once
i hope my children come and visit once or twice a month
soon, i'll be sixty years old, will i think the world is cold
or will i have a lot of children who can warm me?

Let Her Go,Passenger,18321,"well, you only need the light when it's burning low
only miss the sun when it starts to snow
only know you love her when you let her go
only know you've been high when you're feeling low
only hate the road when you're missing home
only know you love her when you let her go
and you let her go
staring at the bottom of your glass
hoping one day you'll make a dream last
but dreams come slow and they go so fast
you see her when you close your eyes
maybe one day you'll understand why
everything you touch surely dies
but you only need the light when it's burning low
only miss the sun when it starts to snow
only know you love her when you let her go
only know you've been high when you're feeling low
only hate the road when you're missing home
only know you love her when you let her go
staring at the ceiling in the dark
same old empty feeling in your heart
'cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
well, you see her when you fall asleep
but never to touch and never to keep
'cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep
well, you only need the light when it's burning low
only miss the sun when it starts to snow
only know you love her when you let her go
only know you've been high when you're feeling low
only hate the road when you're missing home
only know you love her when you let her go
and you let her go, oh, woah, mm, oh
and you let her go, oh, woah, uh, no
well, you let her go
'cause you only need the light when it's burning low
only miss the sun when it starts to snow
only know you love her when you let her go
only know you've been high when you're feeling low
only hate the road when you're missing home
only know you love her when you let her go

only miss the sun when it starts to snow

only know you've been high when you're feeling low
only hate the road when you're missing home

'Till I Collapse,Eminem,18298,"(
yo, left, yo, left
) 'cause sometimes you just feel tired
(
yo, left, right, left
) feel weak, and when you feel weak
(
yo, left, yo, left
) you feel like you wanna just give up
(
yo, left, right, left
) but you gotta search within you
(
yo, left, yo, left
) try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
(
yo, left, right, left
) and get that motivation to not give up
(
yo, left, yo, left
) and not be a quitter
(
yo, left, right, left
) no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
'til i collapse, i'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'til the day that i drop, you'll never say that i'm not killin' 'em
'cause when i am not, then i'ma stop pennin' 'em
and i am not hip-hop and i'm just not eminem
subliminal thoughts, when i'ma stop sendin' 'em?
women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
amoxicillin's just not real enough
the criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
a minimal swap to cop millions of pac listeners
you're comin' with me, feel it or not
you're gonna fear it like i showed ya the spirit of god lives in us
you hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
is it a miracle or am i just product of pop fizzin' up?
fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
you bizzles forgot, slizzle does not give a fuck

'til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'til the smoke clears out, am i high? perhaps
i'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out ('til the roof, until the roof)
'til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'til the smoke clears out, am i high? perhaps ('til my legs, until my legs)
i'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (give out from underneath me)
music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
when you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
this is your moment, and every single minute you spend
tryna hold on to it, 'cause you may never get it again
so while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
and when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'cause i'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
i got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
it goes: reggie, jay-z, 2pac and biggie
andré from outkast, jada, kurupt, nas, and then me
but in this industry i'm the cause of a lot of envy
so when i'm not put on this list, this shit does not offend me
that's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
you hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
the press's wet dream, like bobby and whitney—nate, hit me

i'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (give out from underneath me)
soon as a verse starts, i eat at an mc's heart
what is he thinking? how not to go against me, smart
and it's absurd how people hang on every word
i'll prob'ly never get the props i feel i ever deserve
but i'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
if i ever leave earth, that would be the death of me first
'cause in my heart of hearts i know nothin' could ever be worse
that's why i'm clever when i put together every verse
my thoughts are sporadic, i act like i'm an addict
i rap like i'm addicted to smack like i'm kim mathers
but i don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
the fact is i would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
so this is like a full-blown attack i'm launchin' at 'em
the track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
'cause i don't really think that the fact that i'm slim matters
a plaque and platinum status is wack if i'm not the baddest, so

quiero estar contigo
ámame, solo ámame
si no tengo frenos sobre la acera, ¿todavía me amarías?
si minimizo mi patrimonio neto, ¿todavía me amarías?
mantente constante, preferiría que confíes en mí antes que amarme
mantenlo al cien: no te tengo, no tengo nada
ayy, tengo algo
espera, nosotros funcionamos sin suposiciones
me siento como tyson con eso
golpéalo dos veces, estoy con eso
solo por la noche, estoy bromeando
solo por la vida, sí, solo por la vida, sí
solo por la vida, sí, consigamoslo
golpea ese hombro delgado
sé lo que significa
de espalda a altamar
sé lo que necesitas
ya en diez, todo el dinero entra
todo sentimiento sale, este sentimiento no se seca
esta fiesta no terminará
si no tengo frenos sobre la acera, ¿todavía me amarías?
si minimizo mi patrimonio neto, ¿todavía me amarías?
mantente constante, preferiría que confíes en mí antes que amarme
mantenlo al cien: no te tengo, no tengo nada
dame una oportunidad por mi dinero
no hay nadie, nadie que me supere
así que dame una oportunidad por mi dinero
bebiendo champán, sintiendo con amor, viviendo con amor
solo ámame
quiero estar contigo, ayy, quiero estar con...
solo ámame, solo ámame, solo ama
quiero estar contigo, ayy, quiero estar con...
ámame
quiero estar contigo
ámame, solo ámame
estoy en camino
no tenemos tiempo que perder
explota tu chicle en el camino (ámame)
¿estoy en el camino?
no quiero presionarte
quiero tu bendición hoy (ámame)
oh, por cierto, abre la puerta por el camino
te dije que estoy en camino (ámame)
estoy en camino, sé que la conexión es vaga
levanta el teléfono para mí, bebé
maldición, interferimos
la mala actitud de tu abuela
las curvas y caderas de tu abuela
recuerda gardena, tomé la cámara de estudio
sé que top estará enojado conmigo
tuve que hacerlo, quiero tu cuerpo, tu música
compré un anillo para probarlo
mira lo que hiciste
te dije que estoy en camino
soy como un camino de salida, sí
si no tengo frenos sobre la acera, ¿todavía me amarías?
si minimizo mi patrimonio neto, ¿todavía me amarías?
mantente constante, preferiría que confíes en mí antes que amarme
mantenlo al cien: no te tengo, no tengo nada
dame una oportunidad por mi dinero
no hay nadie, nadie que me supere
así que dame una oportunidad por mi dinero
bebiendo champán, sintiendo con amor, viviendo con amor
solo ámame
quiero estar contigo, ayy, quiero estar con...
solo ámame, solo ámame, solo ama
quiero estar contigo, ayy, quiero estar con...

when the sadness leaves you broken in your bed

Photograph,Ed Sheeran,17996,"lovin' can hurt
lovin' can hurt sometimes
but it's the only thing that i know
and when it gets hard
you know it can get hard sometimes
it is the only thing that makes us feel alive
we keep this love in a photograph
we made these memories for ourselves
where our eyes are never closin'
hearts are never broken
and time's forever frozen still
so you can keep me
inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
holdin' me closer 'til our eyes meet
you won't ever be alone
wait for me to come home
lovin' can heal
lovin' can mend your soul
and it's the only thing that i know, know
i swear it will get easier
remember that with every piece of ya

mm, we keep this love in this photograph
we made these memories for ourselves
where our eyes are never closin'
hearts were never broken
and time's forever frozen still
so you can keep me
inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
holdin' me closer 'til our eyes meet
you won't ever be alone

inside these pages, you just hold me

inside that necklace you got when you were sixteen
next to your heartbeat, where i should be
keep it deep within your soul

sometimes the silence guides a mind
to move to a place so far away
the goosebumps start to raise
the minute that my left hand meets your waist
and then i watch your face
put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love the taste, yeah
these hearts adore
everyone the other beats hardest for

outside, it starts to pour

but it's better than drinkin' alone

well, we're all in the mood for a melody

and the manager gives me a smile
'cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
to forget about life for a while
and the piano, it sounds like a carnival
and the microphone smells like a beer
and they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
and say, ""man, what are you doin' here?""

bitches all around, while i'm sipping on whiskey
middle school thuggin', had a bitch on the slide
be your best friend, to get your sister aside
her boyfriend's gone, seen him leaving in the cab
comes to me crying','bout the reason that his mad
pretend to listen for an hour, then we leaving to the pad
roll that ass over, then i eat it from the back
vip up in your party, with the baddest here
bring 'em back, acting like i'm cavalier
on my bed, setting up my camera gear
i don't have light bulb moments, i have chandeliers
getting high to fuck, bitches are kinky
g's on repeat, like when i listen to fifty
""thats my girl!"", said i'm bringing her with me
she'll be back in morning, breath stinking of whiskey
when these sluts around me, they know how to act
occasionally i rap, so getting x's in our chats
your bea up on my lap, when she naked in my pad
she making that shit clap, when she take it from the back
never judge a girl, by her profile pic
just fishing for those likes, when they shows those tits
filters all over, that photo clicked
up in real life, you wouldn't even know that bitch
before i get a girl, living all my fantasies
first double check she looks the same up in reality
thats the difference bruh, between you and i
you never come correct, i always do it right
kissing on your girl, fuck the bro code bitch
saying that i won't, while she blows my dick
shows her best parts first, like a promo clip
fighting over bitches, is some homo shit
'ish know my stance, won't hold your hand
we won't slow dance, theres no romance
go back to ex man, go head fam
you been used & stretched out, like an old headband

wishing to be the friction in your jeans

i'm just a notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song
drop a heart, break a name
we're always sleeping in and sleeping for the wrong team

How to Save a Life,The Fray,16316,"step one, you say, ""we need to talk""
he walks, you say, ""sit down, it's just a talk""
he smiles politely back at you
you stare politely right on through
some sort of window to your right
as he goes left and you stay right
between the lines of fear and blame
you begin to wonder why you came
where did i go wrong? i lost a friend
somewhere along in the bitterness
and i would have stayed up with you all night
had i known how to save a life
let him know that you know best
'cause after all, you do know best
try to slip past his defense
without granting innocence
lay down a list of what is wrong
the things you've told him all along
pray to god he hears you
and pray to god he hears you, and
where did i go wrong? i lost a friend
somewhere along in the bitterness
and i would have stayed up with you all night
had i known how to save a life
as he begins to raise his voice
you lower yours and grant him one last choice
drive until you lose the road
or break with the ones you've followed
he will do one of two things
he will admit to everything
or he'll say he's just not the same
and you'll begin to wonder why you came
where did i go wrong? i lost a friend
somewhere along in the bitterness
and i would have stayed up with you all night
had i known how to save a life
where did i go wrong? i lost a friend
somewhere along in the bitterness
and i would have stayed up with you all night

when there's a boss in me, i'll be damned

Jessie's Girl,Rick Springfield,16236,"jessie is a friend
yeah, i know, he's been a good friend of mine
but lately something's changed that ain't hard to define
jessie's got himself a girl, and i wanna make her mine
and she's watching him with those eyes
and she's lovin' him with that body, i just know it
and he's holding her in his arms late, late at night
you know, i wish that i had jessie's girl
i wish that i had jessie's girl
where can i find a woman like that?
i'll play along with this charade
that doesn't seem to be a reason to change
you know, i feel so dirty when they start talking cute
i wanna tell her that i love her, but the point is probably moot
'cause she's watching him with those eyes
and she's lovin' him with that body, i just know it
and he's holding her in his arms late, late at night
you know, i wish that i had jessie's girl

i wish that i had jessie's girl
where can i find a woman?
where can i find a woman like that?
and i'm lookin' in the mirror all the time
wonderin' what she don't see in me
i've been funny; i've been cool with the lines
ain't that the way love's supposed to be?
tell me, where can i find a woman like that?
you know, i wish that i had jessie's girl

but as long as you are with me, there's no place i'd rather be
i would wait forever, exalted in the scene
as long as i am with you, my heart continues to beat
with every step we take, kyoto to the bay
strolling so casually
we're different and the same, gave you another name
switch up the batteries
if you gave me a chance, i would take it
it's a shot in the dark but i'll make it
know with all of your heart you can't shame me
when i am with you, there's no place i'd rather be
n-n-n-no, no, no, no place i'd rather be
n-n-n-no, no, no, no place i'd rather be
n-n-n-no, no, no, no place i'd rather be
we staked out on a mission to find our inner peace
make it everlasting so nothing's incomplete
it's easy being with you, sacred simplicity
as long as we're together, there's no place i'd rather be
with every step we take, kyoto to the bay
strolling so casually
we're different and the same, gave you another name
switch up the batteries
if you gave me a chance, i would take it
it's a shot in the dark but i'll make it
know with all of your heart you can't shame me
when i am with you, there's no place i'd rather be
n-n-n-no, no, no, no place i'd rather be
n-n-n-no, no, no, no place i'd rather be
n-n-n-no, no, no, no place i'd rather be
when i am with you, there's no place i'd rather be
hmm, hoo
be, be, be, be, be, be, be, be, be
yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah, yeah, yeah
if you gave me a chance, i would take it
it's a shot in the dark but i'll make it
know with all of your heart you can't shame me
when i am with you, there's no place i'd rather be
n-n-n-no, no, no, no place i'd rather be
n-n-n-no, no, no, no place i'd rather be
n-n-n-no, no, no, no place i'd rather be

Africa,Toto,15660,"i hear the drums echoin' tonight

hopin' to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
he turned to me as if to say
""hurry, boy, it's waitin' there for you""
it's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
there's nothin' that a hundred men or more could ever do
i bless the rains down in africa
gonna take some time to do the things we never had

the wild dogs cry out in the night
as they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
i know that i must do what's right
as sure as kilimanjaro rises like olympus above the serengeti
i seek to cure what's deep inside
frightened of this thing that i've become
it's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

All My Friends,Snakehips,15652,"uh-huh, hoo
we open with the vultures, kissing the cannibals
sure, i get lonely, when i'm the only
only human in the heaving heat of the animals
bitter, brown salt, stinging on my tongue, ah
heart will not waver, heart will not wait its turn
it will beat, it will burn, burn
burn your love into the ground with the lips of another
do you get lonely? sure, i get lonely sometimes
all my friends are wasted

popping the polar opposite of nzt (hunh)
hip-hop and the propaganda say they name-brand (name-brand)
but i done seen how the

did my main man (main man)
the nights we won't remember are the nights we won't remember (igh!)
i'll be gone 'til november, all my city call for simba (igh!)
dreams are made for cages, nigga, lions are for real
nigga, dying is for real, niggas dying off of pills (woo!)
nigga, fridays are for chill and i escaped the treachery
i just had to rest-in-peace the recipe
the rest of us are prayin' that the sand will leave a tan
if you're up right now, hope you hear what i'm saying
hope you hear what i'm saying

do you get lonely? sure, i get lonely, some nights
when the angels on my shoulder slumber and i'm stuck here
with the vultures, hissing and circling
you didn't call me (call me, call me, call me)
ooh, i'm crawling, crawling
crawling back to you (igh!)

Chicken Fried,Zac Brown Band,15618,"you know i like my chicken fried
cold beer on a friday night
a pair of jeans that fit just right
and the radio up
well i was raised up beneath the shade of a georgia pine
and that's home, you know
sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine
where the peaches grow
and my house, it's not much to talk about
but it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground
and a little bit of chicken fried
cold beer on a friday night
a pair of jeans that fit just right
and the radio up
well i've seen the sun rise
see the love in my woman's eyes
feel the touch of a precious child
and know a mother's love
it's funny how it's the little things in life
that mean the most
not where you live, what you drive
or the price tag on your clothes
there's no dollar sign on a piece of mind
this i've come to know
so if you agree, have a drink with me
raise your glasses for a toast
to a little bit of chicken fried
cold beer on a friday night
a pair of jeans that fit just right
and the radio up
well i've seen the sun rise
see the love in my woman's eyes
feel the touch of a precious child
and know a mother's love
i thank god for my life
and for the stars and stripes
may freedom forever fly, let it ring
salute the ones who died
the ones that give their lives
so we don't have to sacrifice
all the things we love
like our chicken fried
and cold beer on a friday night
a pair of jeans that fit just right
and the radio up
well i've seen the sun rise
see the love in my woman's eyes
feel the touch of a precious child
and know a mother's love
get your little chicken fried
cold beer on a friday night
a pair of jeans that fit just right
and the radio up
well i've done seen the sun rise
see the love in my woman's eyes
feel the touch of a precious child
and know a mother's love"

well, baby, they're tumblin' down

burnin' through my darkest night
you're the only one that i want
think i'm addicted to your light
i swore i'd never fall again
but this don't even feel like fallin'
gravity can't begin
to pull me back to the ground again

she said they love me unconditional
imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
you know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
damn, okay, from that perspective
i see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'cause me, i was tryna find out where i lost 'em at
but maybe i ain't lose 'em at all
maybe i keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
but when they need a favor, who do they call?
maybe i'm searchin' for the problems askin' what was said and who was involved
too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
they say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
these days feel like i'm squeezin' in 'em
whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough, i'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'cause if i run the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
no pun intended, but they smellin' defeat in the air
headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
they tell him that he talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
we already got spring 2015 poppin'
pnd droppin', reps-up p droppin'
majid jordan droppin', ob droppin', not to mention me droppin'
feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
me and noel been at it before twitter names
yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
and i can't even name one person that's keepin' up
damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'cause i'm only twenty-seven and i'm only gettin' better
if i haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real
could it be the way that i'll catch up
could it be the way that i'll catch up
could it be the way that i'll catch up
could it be the way that i'll catch up
could it be the way that i'll catch up

who's probably gonna sin again
lord, forgive me, lord, forgive me
things i don't understand
sometimes, i need to be alone
bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
i can feel your energy from two planets away
i got my drink, i got my music, i would share it, but, today, i'm yellin'
bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibebitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
i can feel the changes
i can feel a new life, i always knew life can be dangerous
i can say that i like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
you don't know what pain is
how can i paint this picture when the colorblind is hangin' witcha?
fell on my face and awoke with a scar, another mistake livin' deep in my heart
wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick, i can admit that it did look like yours
why you resent every makin' of his? tell me your purpose is petty again
but even a small lighter can burn a bridge, even a small lighter can burn a bridge
i can feel the changes
i can feel the new people 'round me just wanna be famous
you can see that my city found me, then put me on stages

i know what you're scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
this shit is vital, i know you had to, this shit is vital, i know you had to
die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain is way more believable
give me a feasible gain, rather a seasonal name, i'll let the people know
this is somethin' you can blame on yourself, you can remain stuck in a box

we got, yeah, we got a lot at stake
and in the end, you're still my friend, at least we did intend
for us to work, we didn't break, we didn't burn
we had to learn, how to bend without the world caving in
i had to learn what i got, and what i'm not

beating on his chest like a bongo
he understands she's coming from a hurt place
answers all the questions on her survey
doesn't get jealous, doesn't break trust
doesn't call her, ""ho"" after hang-ups
give her everything she ever wanted

always going to court, but i'm never pleadin' guilty
ballin' so hard i only be slam dunkin'
beat steady rock and the trunk straight thumpin'
i be ridin' foreign, pourin' merlot while i swerve
pedal to the medal when i'm whippin' round the curb
and i'm rollin' up this marijuana, you can smell the herb
and i be getting all this lettuce, i ain't talkin' iceberg
i've been getting dirty money; jordan belfort
stacking penny stocks while i'm flipping these birds
sipping on ciroc, trip 'em up with the words
i just popped a molly and i think this be my third

stacking penny stocks while i'm flipping these birds
jordan belfort, burberry shirt
lv loafers on my sofa in bel-air
turnin' up daily cause we can't turn down at work
i been lightin' loud lately like my volume switch don't work
and my cologne is versace, medusa got me stoned
i'm always high on something, but i usually like to smoke
we been long time friends, me and ben frank
every fucking day he needs a ride home from the bank
muhfucka, you don't know me, you ain't in my tax section
my wallet ain't fat, it's in the gym straight flexing
i don't call your bitch back and she's checkin' her reception
bitch with double d's, she's all up on my erection
and i'm in the ovaries, but i ain't about affection
so easily the sober me just smokes and then forgets them
sometimes this life seems a little stressful
especially when they tell me that i am something special

marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
a teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
and buy me a star on the boulevard, it's californication
space may be the final frontier, but it's made in a hollywood basement
and cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off
station to station? and alderaan's not far away, it's californication
born and raised by those who praise control of population
well, everybody's been there, and i don't mean on vacation
firstborn unicorn
hardcore soft porn
dream of californication
dream of californication
dream of californication
dream of californication
destruction leads to a very rough road, but it also breeds creation
and earthquakes are to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration
and tidal waves couldn't save the world from californication
pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
sicker than the rest, there is no test, but this is what you're craving

my grandma just died, i'm the man of the house
so every morning i'm up 'cause i can't let them down, down
always down for the cause, never down for the count
i guess when your stars align, you do like the solar system and plan it out
so i'm going over time on the overtime
yeah, i'm that invested, but you can't attest it
million-dollar goals, managed to manifest it
the family never goin' anorexic
i pay my own mortgage and electric
never goin' under, even with anesthetics
at the top of the rap game and progressin'
check after check, checkin' off my checklist
try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
no mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
shit feel like shaq and penny got back together
you tore the game apart, who put it back together?

since the truth keep niggas traumatized
they tryna compromise my condom size
so i snapchat that whole shit
tryna see titties, tryna show dick
and i swear to god, i hope they post it, i'm blessed
even though i get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
see three pos like star wars
they want me by the road holdin' up cardboard
so i go extra hard on the hard floor
right now, i'm callin' you from my home gym
right after that, nigga, i'm gon' swim
just did a couple laps in my home pool
and my daughter right there gettin' homeschooled, i'm blessed
and i was thinking 'bout starting up my own school, a montessori
and the hallway lookin' like a monastery, oh, yes

Come and See Me (feat. Drake),PARTYNEXTDOOR,14815,"doesn't make sense now
shit just got real, things are gettin' intense now
i hear you talkin' 'bout ""we"" a lot, oh, you speak french now?
giving me the signs so i gotta take a hint now
i hit you up like ""do you wanna hang right now?""
on the east side and you know i'm with the gang right now
you say do i own a watch, do i know what time it is right now
it's after 2 a.m. and that's askin' a lot of you right now
all she talkin' bout is, ""come and see me for once
come and see me for once
you don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me""
all she ever say is, ""come and see me for once
come and see me for once
you don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me""
i been up for two whole days thinkin' what i did to keep you goin'
thumbin' through the voicemails that you left me tellin' me where i went wrong
i'll admit i'm sorry when i feel i'm truly sorry
things change, people change, feelings change too
never thought the circumstances woulda changed you
you said you never traded, no (yeah, you said that)
and i believed you when they told me don't
(yeah, i thought you meant that)
but either way you're still invited and i can't even lie to you
swear these days all you say is, ""come and see me for once
come and see me for once
you don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me""
all she hit me with is, ""come and see me for once
come and see me for once, oh
you don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
""
why you gotta start, girl, why you gotta start?
i know we make time for the things that we want
i know you got another nigga tryna play the part
just 'cause he got a heart don't mean he got heart
could be standin' in a field, and he still ain't in the field
if anything should change then i thought we had a deal
lately you keep questionin' what you get out the deal
doin' things to make me feel the way i make you feel
how hard is it to let you know when i'm comin' home?
that way you can be prepared
maybe take a couple sick days and not miss pay
i don't even know what things are looking like inside of your place
or how it's decorated
this thing is gettin' one-sided, i can't even lie to you right now
yeah
all she talkin' bout is, ""come and see me for once
come and see me for once
you don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me""
all she hit me with is, ""come and see me for once
come and see me for once
you don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"""

ten times out of nine, now if i'm lyin', find
the quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and i'll decline
king meets queen, then the puppy love thing
together dream 'bout that crib with the goodyear swing
on the oak tree, i hope we feel like this forever
forever, forever ever? forever ever?
forever never seems that long until you're grown
and notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
ms. jackson, my intentions were good, i wish i could
become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
i pray so much about it, need some knee pads
it happened for a reason, one can't be mad
so know this, know that everything's cool
and yes, i will be present on the first day of school and graduation

¿es al dinero? ¿es la fama? ¿es la marihuana? ¿es la bebida?
¿se vendrá abajo con las bulliciosas pipas y la lluvia?
es un gran disfrute, solo por el poder sobre tu nombre
dime a quién le eres leal
¿es al amor por las calles cuando las luces se apagan?
¿es incondicional cuando el 'rari no enciende?
dímelo cuando tu lealtad surja de tu corazón
dime a quién le eres leal
¿empieza con tus mujeres o tu hombre?
(mmm)
¿termina con tu familia y amigos?
(mmm)
¿o eres leal a ti mismo por adelantado?
dije, dime a quién le eres leal
¿es alguien por quien mentirías?
¿alguien por quien te deslizarías?
¿alguien por quien morirías?

More Than a Feeling,Boston,14139,"i looked out this morning and the sun was gone
turned on some music to start my day
i lost myself in a familiar song
i closed my eyes and i slipped away
it's more than a feeling (more than a feeling)
when i hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
and i begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
'til i see marianne walk away
i see my marianne walkin' away
so many people have come and gone
their faces fade as the years go by
yet i still recall as i wander on
as clear as the sun in the summer sky
it's more than a feeling (more than a feeling)
when i hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
and i begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
'til i see marianne walk away
i see my marianne walkin' away
when i'm tired and thinking cold
i hide in my music, forget the day
and dream of a girl i used to know
i closed my eyes and she slipped away
she slipped away
it's more than a feeling (more than a feeling)

Carry on Wayward Son,Kansas,14071,"carry on, my wayward son
there'll be peace when you are done
lay your weary head to rest
don't you cry no more
once i rose above the noise and confusion
just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
i was soaring ever higher, but i flew too high
though my eyes could see, i still was a blind man
though my mind could think, i still was a madman
i hear the voices when i'm dreaming
i can hear them say
carry on, my wayward son
there'll be peace when you are done
lay your weary head to rest
don't you cry no more
masquerading as a man with a reason
my charade is the event of the season
and if i claim to be a wise man, well
it surely means that i don't know
on a stormy sea of moving emotion
tossed about, i'm like a ship on the ocean
i set a course for winds of fortune
but i hear the voices say
carry on, my wayward son
there'll be peace when you are done
lay your weary head to rest
don't you cry no more (no)
(carry on) you will always remember
(carry on) nothing equals the splendor
now your life's no longer empty
surely heaven waits for you

You & Me,Marc E. Bassy,13717,"girl you party all the time
don't let me stay on your mind
adderall and cheap wine
just to stay awake in conversation
we were always so damn insecure
so how could we ever know for sure
and disregard the way i know we feel
that would make this city way too real
if we bump into each other
on a crowded street
it's not us no more
it's just you and me
we're just strangers in passing casually
it's not us no more
it's just you and me
the shirt on my back with the rips
gems in my golden necklace
you didn't give me none of this
there's nothing for me to miss
we were too young on the day we met
how could we say we would not forget
and in the shadows there's a place for us
somewhere hidden they can't find our love
don't let 'em know
if we bump into each other
on a crowded street
it's not us no more
it's just you and me
we're just strangers in passing casually
it's not us no more
it's just you and me
eazy, and these days it's just you and me
this shit is dead and gone, it's not what it used to be
someone give a eulogy
know i'm hard headed and i might of acted foolishly
but you the one to hold us down usually
we was in a limbo
but of all people you ain't have to fuck with him though
that was my homie i had gave y'all the intro
some things fall apart and some get thrown out the window
remember when we first met we might've been too young
but we was from the bay so we both was going too dumb
i used to be the one for you now you got a new one
so till the next lifetime, maybe we can do some'n
eazy
if we bump into each other
on a crowded street
it's not us no more
it's just you and me
we're just strangers in passing casually
it's not us no more it's just you and me
if we bump into each other
on a crowded street
it's not us no more"

""now the old king is dead, long live the king""

next, the walls were closed on me

blew down the doors to let me in
shattered windows and the sound of drums

and revolutionaries wait
for my head on a silver plate
just a puppet on a lonely string (

Here,Alessia Cara,13332,"i guess right now you've got the last laugh
i'm sorry if i seem uninterested

truly i ain't got no business here

but really, i would rather be at home all by myself
not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
i don't dance, don't ask, i don't need a boyfriend
so, you can go back, please, enjoy your party
i'll be here, somewhere in the corner
under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
i can hardly hear over this music i don't listen to
and i don't wanna get with you, so tell my friends that i'll be over here
oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
oh-oh-oh, i ask myself, what am i doin' here?
oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
and i can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
excuse me if i seem a little unimpressed with this
an anti-social pessimist, but usually i don't mess with this
and i know you mean only the best
and your intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly, i'd rather be
somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
some music with a message, like we usually do
and we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan to take over the planet
so, pardon my manners, i hope you'll understand that i'll be here
not there in the kitchen
with the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
so, tell them i'll be here
right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
oh god, why am i here?
oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
oh-oh-oh, i ask myself, what am i doin' here?
oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
and i can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
hours later, congregatin' next to the refrigerator
some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
how did it ever come to this? i should've never come to this
so holla at me, i'll be in the car when you're done
i'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
and i'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
so tell my people when they're ready that i'm ready
and i'm standin' by the tv with my beanie low
yo, i'll be over here
oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
oh-oh-oh, i ask myself, what am i doin' here?

i got a dalmatian and i can still get high
i can play the guitar like a motherfuckin' riot
well, life is (too short), so love the one you got
'cause you might get run over or you might get shot
never start no static, i just get it off my chest
never had to battle with no bulletproof vest
take a small example, take a ti-ti-ti-tip from me
take all of your money, give it all to charity-ty-ty-ty
love is what i got, it's within my reach
and the sublime style's still straight from long beach
it all comes back to you, you're bound to get what you deserve
try and test that, you're bound to get served
love's what i got, don't start a riot
you'll feel it when the dance gets hot
lovin' is what i got
i said, remember that
lovin' is what i got
and remember that
lovin' is what i got
i said, remember that
lovin' is what i got
(i got, i got, i got)
why i don't cry when my dog runs away
i don't get angry at the bills i have to pay
i don't get angry when my mom smokes pot
hits the bottle and goes right to the rock
fuckin' and fightin'; it's all the same
living with louie dog's the only way to stay sane
let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me

Better Together,Jack Johnson,13207,"there's no combination of words i could put on the back of a postcard
no song that i could sing but i can try for your heart
our dreams and they are made out of real things
like a shoebox of photographs with sepia-toned loving
love is the answer, at least for most of the questions in my heart
like why are we here and where do we go, and how come it's so hard?
it's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving
i'll tell you one thing, it's always better when we're together
mmm, it's always better when we're together
yeah, we'll look at them stars and we're together
well, it's always better when we're together
yeah, it's always better when we're together
and all of these moments just might find their way into my dreams tonight
but i know that they'll be gone when the morning light sings
or brings new things, for tomorrow night, you see
that they'll be gone too, too many things i have to do
but if all of these dreams might find their way into my day to day scene
i'd be under the impression i was somewhere in between
with only two, just me and you, not so many things we got to do
or places we got to be, we'll sit beneath the mango tree now
yeah, it's always better when we're together
mmm, we're somewhere in between together
well, it's always better when we're together
yeah, it's always better when we're together

i believe in memories
they look so, so pretty when i sleep
and i when, and when i wake up
you look so pretty, sleeping next to me
but there is not enough time
and there is no, no song i could sing
and there is no combination of words i could say
but i will still tell you one thing
we're better together"

Rap God,Eminem,13116,"""look, i was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings""
""but i'm only going to get this one chance"" (
six minutes—, six minutes—
)
""something's wrong, i can feel it"" (
six minutes, slim shady, you're on!
)
""just a feeling i've got, like something's about to happen, but i don't know what.
if that means what i think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble;
and if he is as bananas as you say, i'm not taking any chances""
""you are just what the doc ordered""
i'm beginnin' to feel like a rap god, rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
they said i rap like a robot, so call me rap-bot
but for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
i got a laptop in my back pocket
my pen'll go off when i half-cock it
got a fat knot from that rap profit
made a livin' and a killin' off it
ever since bill clinton was still in office
with monica lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
i'm an mc still as honest
but as rude and as indecent as all hell
syllables, skill-a-holic (
kill 'em all with
)
this flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
you don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
with this rappity brat, packin' a mac in the back of the ac'
backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
and at the exact same time, i attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while i'm practicin' that
i'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
only realized it was ironic, i was signed to aftermath after the fact
how could i not blow? all i do is drop f-bombs
feel my wrath of attack
rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
it's actually disastrously bad for the wack
while i'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce
'cause i'm beginnin' to feel like a rap god, rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like i have got
well, to be truthful the blueprint's
simply rage and youthful exuberance
everybody loves to root for a nuisance
hit the earth like an asteroid
did nothing but shoot for the moon since (pew!)
mcs get taken to school with this music
'cause i use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
now i lead a new school full of students
me? i'm a product of rakim
lakim shabazz, 2pac, n.w.a, cube, hey doc, ren
yella, eazy, thank you, they got slim
inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
to meet run–d.m.c., and induct them
into the motherfuckin' rock and roll hall of fame
even though i'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
only hall of fame i'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
on the wall of
shame
you fags think it's all a game, 'til i walk a flock of flames
off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
little gay-lookin' boy
so gay i can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (ha-ha!)
you're witnessin' a mass-occur
like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
you get a thumbs up, pat on the back
and a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
hey, lookin' boy! what you say, lookin' boy?
i get a ""hell yeah"" from dre, lookin' boy
i'ma work for everything i have, never asked nobody for shit
get outta my face, lookin' boy!
basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—
i'm beginnin' to feel like a rap god, rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
the way i'm racin' around the track, call me nascar, nascar
dale earnhardt of the trailer park, the white trash god
kneel before general zod
this planet's krypton—no, asgard, asgard
so you'll be thor and i'll be odin
you rodent, i'm omnipotent
let off, then i'm reloadin'
immediately with these bombs i'm totin'
and i should not be woken
i'm the walkin' dead, but i'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
but i got your mom deep-throatin'
i'm out my ramen noodle
we have nothin' in common, poodle
i'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
it's me, my honesty's brutal
but it's honestly futile if i don't utilize what i do though
for good at least once in a while
so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes
to maybe try to help get some people through tough times
but i gotta keep a few punchlines
just in case 'cause even you unsigned
rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
i know there was a time where once i
was king of the underground
but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind
so i crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
appeal with the skin color of mine
you get too big and here they come tryin'
to censor you like that one line
i said on ""i'm back"" from
the mathers lp 1
when i
tried to say i'll take seven kids from columbine
put 'em all in a line, add an ak-47, a revolver and a 9
see if i get away with it now that i ain't as big as i was, but i'm
morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
you're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
and i don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
you're pointless as rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
you write normal? fuck being normal!
and i just bought a new raygun from the future
just to come and shoot ya, like when fabolous made ray j mad
'cause fab said he looked like a fag at mayweather's pad
singin' to a man while he played piano
man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
so ray j went straight to the radio station
the very next day, ""hey fab, i'ma kill you!""
lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (
j.j. fad
)
uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' i'm a human
what i gotta do to get it through to you? i'm superhuman
innovative and i'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
i'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
how to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
never fading, and i know the haters are forever waiting
for the day that they can say i fell off, they'll be celebrating
'cause i know the way to get 'em motivated
i make elevating music, you make elevator music
""oh, he's too mainstream.""
well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""it's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause i found a hella way to fuse it
with rock, shock rap with doc
throw on ""lose yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""i don't know how to make songs like that
i don't know what words to use.""
let me know when it occurs to you
while i'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
it's curtains, i'm inadvertently hurtin' you
how many verses i gotta murder to
prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
but look at the accolades these skills brung me
full of myself, but still hungry
i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to
and i'm a million leagues above you
ill when i speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
i'm drunk, so, satan, take the fucking wheel
i'ma sleep in the front seat
bumpin' heavy d and the boyz, still ""chunky but funky""
but in my head there's something i can feel tugging and struggling
angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
they're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
i have, then you may be a little patient
and more sympathetic to the situation
and understand the discrimination
but fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? make lemonade then!
but if i can't batter the women
how the fuck am i supposed to bake 'em a cake then?
don't mistake him for
satan
it's a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation
to trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
don't be a retard—be a king? think not
why be a king when you can be a god?"

American Pie,Don McLean,12996,"a long, long time ago
i can still remember how that music
used to make me smile
and i knew if i had my chance
that i could make those people dance
and maybe they'd be happy for a while
but february made me shiver
with every paper i'd deliver
bad news on the doorstep
i couldn't take one more step
i can't remember if i cried
when i read about his widowed bride
but something touched me deep inside
the day the music died
so, bye-bye, miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
and them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
singin', ""this'll be the day that i die
this'll be the day that i die""
did you write the book of love?
and do you have faith in god above
if the bible tells you so?
now, do you believe in rock 'n' roll?
can music save your mortal soul?
and can you teach me how to dance real slow?
well, i know that you're in love with him
'cause i saw you dancin' in the gym
you both kicked off your shoes
man, i dig those rhythm and blues
i was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
with a pink carnation and a pickup truck
but i knew i was out of luck
the day the music died
i started singin' bye-bye, miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
and singin', ""this'll be the day that i die
this'll be the day that i die""
now, for ten years we've been on our own
and moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
but that's not how it used to be
when the jester sang for the king and queen
in a coat he borrowed from james dean
and a voice that came from you and me
oh, and while the king was looking down
the jester stole his thorny crown
the courtroom was adjourned
no verdict was returned
and while lenin read a book on marx
the quartet practiced in the park
and we sang dirges in the dark
the day the music died
we were singin' bye-bye, miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
and singin', ""this'll be the day that i die
this'll be the day that i die""
helter skelter in a summer swelter
the birds flew off with a fallout shelter
eight miles high and fallin' fast
it landed foul on the grass
the players tried for a forward pass
with the jester on the sidelines in a cast
now, the halftime air was sweet perfume
while sergeants played a marching tune
we all got up to dance
oh, but we never got the chance
'cause the players tried to take the field
the marching band refused to yield
do you recall what was revealed
the day the music died?
we started singin' bye-bye, miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
singin', ""this'll be the day that i die
this'll be the day that i die""
oh, and there we were all in one place
a generation lost in space
with no time left to start again
so, come on, jack be nimble, jack be quick
jack flash sat on a candlestick
'cause fire is the devil's only friend
oh, and as i watched him on the stage
my hands were clenched in fists of rage
no angel born in hell
could break that satan spell
and as the flames climbed high into the night
to light the sacrificial rite
i saw satan laughing with delight
the day the music died
he was singin' bye-bye, miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
singin', ""this'll be the day that i die
this'll be the day that i die""
i met a girl who sang the blues
and i asked her for some happy news
but she just smiled and turned away
i went down to the sacred store
where i'd heard the music years before
but the man there said the music wouldn't play
and in the streets, the children screamed
the lovers cried and the poets dreamed
but not a word was spoken
the church bells all were broken
and the three men i admire most
the father, son, and the holy ghost
they caught the last train for the coast
the day the music died
and there i stood alone and afraid
i dropped to my knees and there i prayed
and i promised him everything i could give
if only he would make the music live
and he promised it would live once more
but this time one would equal four
and in five years four had come to mourn
and the music was reborn
and they were singin' bye-bye, miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
singin', ""this'll be the day that i die
this'll be the day that i die""
they were singin' bye-bye, miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
singin', ""this'll be the day that i die"""

Castle on the Hill,Ed Sheeran,12980,"when i was six years old, i broke my leg
i was runnin' from my brother and his friends
and tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass i rolled down
i was younger then, take me back to when i
found my heart and broke it here
made friends and lost them through the years
and i've not seen the roaring fields in so long, i know i've grown
but i can't wait to go home
i'm on my way
drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
singin' to ""tiny dancer""
and i miss the way you make me feel and it's real
we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
had my first kiss on a friday night, i don't reckon that i did it right
but i was younger then, take me back to when
we found weekend jobs, when we got paid
we'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
but i can't wait to go home
i'm on my way
drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
singin' to ""tiny dancer""
and i miss the way you make me feel and it's real
we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
one friend left to sell clothes
one works down by the coast
one had two kids but lives alone
one's brother overdosed
one's already on his second wife
one's just barely gettin' by
but these people raised me
and i can't wait to go home
and i'm on my way, i still remember
these old country lanes
when we did not know the answers
and i miss the way you make me feel and it's real
we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill"

i'm so used to being in the wrong, i'm tired of caring
loving never gave me a home, so i'll sit here in the silence
i found peace in your violence
can't tell me there's no point in trying
i'm at one and i've been quiet for too long
i found peace in your violence
can't tell me there's no point in trying
i'm at one and i've been silent for too long
i've been quiet for too long
i've been quiet for too long
i found peace in your violence
can't tell me there's no point in trying
i'm at one and i've been quiet for too long"
Play It Again,Luke Bryan,12880,"she was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
tan legs swingin' by a georgia plate
i was lookin' for her boyfriend
thinkin', ""no way, she ain't got one""
soon as i sat down, i was fallin' in love
tryin' to pour a little sugar in her dixie cup
talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
she jumped up and cut me off
she was like, ""oh my god, this is my song
i've been listenin' to the radio all night long
sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
she was like, ""come here, boy, i wanna dance""
'fore i said a word, she was takin' my hand
spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
and she gave me a kiss
and she said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""
and i said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""
i'da gave that dj my last dime
if he would have played it just one more time
but a little while later
we were sittin' in the drive in my truck
before i walked her to the door
i was scannin' like a fool; am, fm, xm too
but i stopped real quick when i heard that groove
man, you should have seen her light up
she was like, ""oh my god, this is my song
we've been listenin' to the radio all night long
i can't believe that it came back on, but here it is""
she was like, ""come here boy, i wanna dance""
'fore i said a word, she was takin' my hand
spinnin' in the headlights, she gave me a goodnight kiss
and i said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""
and she said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""
the next friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
you should have seen her smile when i broke out my guitar
she was like, ""oh my god, this is my song
i've been listenin' to the radio all night long
sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
she was like, ""come here boy, i wanna dance""
'fore i said a word, she was takin' my hand
spinnin' in the headlights, she gave me a goodnight kiss
and she said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""

yeah, play it again, play it again, play it again
somebody play it again, play it again, play it again"
Fix You,Coldplay,12841,"when you try your best, but you don't succeed
when you get what you want, but not what you need
when you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
stuck in reverse
and the tears come streamin' down your face
when you lose somethin' you can't replace
when you love someone, but it goes to waste
could it be worse?
lights will guide you home
and ignite your bones
and i will try to fix you
and high up above or down below
when you're too in love to let it go
but if you never try, you'll never know
just what you're worth
lights will guide you home
and ignite your bones
and i will try
to fix you
tears stream down your face
when you lose somethin' you cannot replace
tears stream down your face, and i...
tears stream down your face
i promise you i will learn from my mistakes
tears stream down your face, and i...
lights will guide you home
and ignite your bones
and i will try to fix you"
The Real Slim Shady,Eminem,12802,"may i have your attention, please?
may i have your attention, please?
will the real slim shady please stand up?
i repeat
will the real slim shady please stand up?
we're gonna have a problem here
y'all act like you never seen a white person before
jaws all on the floor like pam; like tommy just burst in the door
and started whoopin' her ass worse than before
they first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (agh)
it's the return of the ""oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
he didn't just say what i think he did, did he?""
and dr. dre said
nothing, you idiots, dr. dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha-ha)
feminist women love eminem
""chicka-chicka-chicka, slim shady, i'm sick of him
look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
flippin' the you-know-who"", ""yeah, but he's so cute though""
yeah, i probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
but no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
sometimes i wanna get on tv and just let loose
but can't, but it's cool for tom green to hump a dead moose
""my bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
and if i'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
and that's the message that we deliver to little kids
and expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
by the time they hit fourth grade they've got the
discovery channel
, don't they?
we ain't nothin' but mammals
well, some of us cannibals who cut other people open like cantaloupes
but if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
but if you feel like i feel, i got the antidote
women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes
i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up, please stand up?
'cause i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up, please stand up?
will smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (nope)
well, i do, so fuck him, and fuck you too
you think i give a damn about a grammy?
half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""but slim, what if you win? wouldn't it be weird?""
why? so you guys could just lie to get me here?
so you can sit me here next to britney spears?
yo, shit, christina aguilera better switch me chairs
so i can sit next to carson daly and fred durst
and hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
little bitch put me on blast on mtv
""yeah, he's cute, but i think he's married to kim, hee-hee""
i should download her audio on mp3
and show the whole world how you gave eminem vd (agh)
i'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
so i have been sent here to destroy you
and there's a million of us just like me
who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
and just might be the next best thing, but not quite me
'cause i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up, please stand up?
'cause i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up, please stand up?
i'm like a head trip to listen to
'cause i'm only givin' you things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
the only difference is i got the balls to say it in front of y'all
and i don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
i just get on the mic and spit it
and whether you like to admit it (err), i just shit it
better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
then you wonder, ""how can kids eat up these albums like valiums?""
it's funny, 'cause at the rate i'm goin', when i'm thirty
i'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
pinchin' nurse's asses when i'm jacking off with jergens
and i'm jerking, but this whole bag of viagra isn't working
and every single person is a slim shady lurkin'
he could be working at burger king, spittin' on your onion rings (ch, puh)
or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, ""i don't give a fuck!""
with his windows down and his system up
so will the real shady please stand up
and put one of those fingers on each hand up?
and be proud to be out of your mind and out of control
and one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up, please stand up?

yeah, yeah, tudo bem
velhas maneiras, novas mulheres, tenho que manter um equilíbrio
a garota dos seus sonhos pra mim provavelmente não é um desafio
eu tenho contado tantas vezes, e não consegui contar
engraçado como agora o meu contador tá tendo problemas pra contar
para as pessoas que pensam que eu te devo uma coisa
o retorno é uma merda e vocês sabem disso
esses manos estão ficando velhos dеmais pra isso
por favor, não pense que ninguém pеrcebe
eu tenho estado acordado há muitos dias
vocês dormem o suficiente pra mim de qualquer maneira
vocês não fazem merda nenhuma de qualquer maneira
vocês não são fiéis a isso de qualquer maneira
ovo, east end, reps up, podemos apenas ser atingidos com o r.i.c.o
todo mundo tá em casa no verão, então não vamos fazer nada ilegal
eu vou ganhar 50 milhões e depois dar alguns milhões pro meu pessoal
eles vão fazer igual o tony montana e comprarem um shaq nos lances livres
mas eles são do jeito da família, não há muito o que dizer
eles me disseram pra te contar que vocês são uns inúteis
e fica na sua, mano
meu pai é de memphis, e eu sou o rei
eu provavelmente deveria me mudar pra graceland
madonna é uma coisa que eu conheço e eu sou o rei do pop
eu tô construindo a never-never land

podemos apenas ser atingidos com o r.i.c.o
meek milly!
porque estamos em campo com aqueles pássaros como se jogássemos pelo eagles
eu tô em liberdade condicional, então não me deixe falar o que é ilegal (troca isso)
hoje eu acordei com a garota dos meus sonhos, ela é rica igual um beatle
pelos meus professores que falaram que eu não faria isso aqui
eu gasto em um dia o que você ganha em um ano
eu tive que lançar isso pra deixar claro
que eu tranquei igual cabelo de jamaicano
todos esses atiradores sentando o dedo, manos selvagens, violência
por que temos que pegar aqui?
por que ainda jogamos esses jogos?
venha até mim, receba um tratamento facial lá
são os chasers, o que você pensou?
eu passo pelo meu quarteirão como se fosse o rico
empinando a moto, sem errar, não posso falar com os policiais, isso é ilegal
eu era mais um rich porter, sem traição com meu povo
eu joguei um milhão na mesa e dividi com meus manos igualmente
eu tô de volta naquela merda do bairro, yeah, gostaria que você tivesse
eu tô falando o que cruza você e dribla no quarto tempo
tipo o jordan, voltamos nessa besteira
nós viemos do nada
começamos na lista dos mais procurados, mas agora é a lista da forbes
nós realmente estávamos fazendo merda
eu posso ouvir ecos dos federais nessa área de informantes
eu acho que eles estão gravando

Lay Me Down,Sam Smith,12664,"yes, i do, i believe
that one day i will be where i was
right there, right next to you
and it's hard, the days just seem so dark
the moon, the stars are nothing without you
your touch, your skin, where do i begin?
no words can explain the way i'm missing you
deny this emptiness, this hole that i'm inside
these tears, they tell their own story
told me not to cry when you were gone
but the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
can i lay by your side, next to you, you
and make sure you're all right?
i'll take care of you
i don't want to be here if i can't be with you tonight
i'm reaching out to you
can you hear my call?
this hurt that i've been through
i'm missing you, missing you like crazy
you told me not to cry when you were gone
but the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
can i lay by your side, next to you, you
and make sure you're all right?
i'll take care of you
i don't want to be here if i can't be with you tonight
lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
can i lay by your side, next to you? you"

lovin' me is complicated
too afraid of a lot of changes
i'm alright, and you're a favorite
dark nights in my prayers
i remembered you was conflicted
misusing your influence, sometimes i did the same
abusing my power, full of resentment
resentment that turned into a deep depression
found myself screamin' in the hotel room
i didn't wanna self-destruct
the evils of lucy was all around me
so i went runnin' for answers"
Malibu,Miley Cyrus,12642,"i never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
i never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
but you brought me here and i'm happy that you did
'cause now i'm as free as birds catchin' the wind
i always thought i would sink, so i never swam
i never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
and sometimes i get so scared of what i can't understand
but here i am, next to you
the sky's more blue in malibu
next to you in malibu
next to you (baby)
we watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
i'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
you would explain the current as i just smile
hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
and it'll be us just for a while, do they even exist?
that's when i make a wish to swim away with the fish
'cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
i never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
i'd be here writing this song
but here i am, next to you
the sky's so blue in malibu
next to you in malibu
next to you (baby)
ah, ah
ah, ah, ah
next to you
the sky's so blue in malibu (baby)
next to you (oh, oh)

When I Was Your Man,Bruno Mars,12630,"same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
when our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'cause my heart breaks a little when i hear your name
it all just sounds like (ooh, ooh)
mm, too young, too dumb to realize
that i should've bought you flowers
and held your hand
shoulda gave you all my hours
when i had the chance
take you to every party
'cause all you wanted to do was dance
now my baby's dancin'
but she's dancin' with another man
uh, my pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
now i'll never, never get to clean up the mess i made, oh
and that haunts me every time i close my eyes
it all just sounds like (ooh, ooh)
mm, too young, too dumb to realize
that i should've bought you flowers
and held your hand
shoulda gave you all my hours
when i had the chance
take you to every party
'cause all you wanted to do was dance
now my baby's dancin'
but she's dancin' with another man
although it hurts
i'll be the first to say that
i was wrong
oh, i know i'm probably much too late
to try and apologize for my mistakes
but i just want you to know
i hope he buys you flowers
i hope he holds your hand
give you all his hours
when he has the chance
take you to every party
'cause i remember how much you love to dance
do all the things i should've done
when i was your man
do all the things i should've done
when i was your man"
Headlines,Drake,12622,"i might be too strung out on compliments
overdosed on confidence
started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
faded way too long, i'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
and they sayin' i'm back, i'd agree with that
i just take my time with all this shit, i still believe in that
i had someone tell me i fell off, ooh, i needed that
and they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd i leave it at?
i know i exaggerated things, now i got it like that
tuck my napkin in my shirt 'cause i'm just mobbin' like that

that new shit that you got is overdue
you better do what you supposed to do""
i'm like, ""why i gotta be all that?""
but still, i can't deny the fact that it's true
listening to you expressin' all them feelings
soap-opera rappers, all these niggas sound like all my children
and that's who you thinkin' is 'bout to come and make a killin'?
i guess it really is just me, myself, and all my millions
you know that they ain't even got it like that
you gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
'cause i live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
when they get my shit and play it, i ain't even gotta say it, they know

look, just understand that i'm on a roll like cottonelle
i was made for all of this shit
and i'm on the road box office sales
i'm getting paid for all of this shit
ask you to please excuse my table manners
i was making room for the table dancers
'cause if we judging off your advances
then i just got paid like eight advances, goddamn
got everything, i got everything
i cannot complain, i cannot
i don't even know how much i really made, i forgot, it's a lot
fuck that, never mind what i got
nigga don't watch that 'cause i—
came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
no help, that's all me, all me for real
came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me—
ho, shut the fuck up!
i got way too much on my mental
i learn from what i've been through
i'm finna do what i didn't do
and still waking up like the rent's due
not complicated, it's simple
i got sexy ladies, a whole benz-full
and to them hoes i'm everything—everything but gentle
but i still take my time (time)
man, i guess i'm just old fashioned
wearing retro sh—, that's old fashion
nigga, see what i'm saying, no closed caption
i paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
i plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
my new girl is on glee and shit
probably making more money than me and shit
i swear to god i got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
i got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
like i got trust issues
i'm sorry for the people i've pushed out
i'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
and still gotta pull out
but that's just me and i ain't perfect
i ain't a saint but i am worth it
if it's one thing, i am worth it
niggas still hating but it ain't working
lil' bitch...
oh me, oh me, oh my
i think i done fucked too many women from the 305
'fore the end of this year
i'll do king of diamonds 3 more times
smoking on that kush all in our section
like it's legalized
girl, you can't always have your way
sometimes it be like that
they don't really fuck with you like that
they ain't never did me like that
i just took my time, you got the shine
i let you eat like that
i been taught to never loan somebody
what you need right back
and i need that shit right back
(no more free randy) i'm blessed than a muhfucka
niggas been stressed than a muhfucka
niggas getting nervous
clutching they chests like a muhfucka
damn that's a motherfucker
tell the truth, i don't listen to you
'cause i don't like being lied to
and that ship won't sail
and that wind won't guide you
daddy was in jail, we was talking through the window
like a motherfucking drive-thru
that was back then, man
now my niggas rich enough to do whatever i do"

Lost Boy,Ruth B.,12549,"there was a time when i was alone
nowhere to go and no place to call home
my only friend was the man in the moon
and even sometimes he would go away too
then one night, as i closed my eyes
i saw a shadow flying high
he came to me with the sweetest smile
told me he wanted to talk for a while
he said, ""peter pan, that's what they call me
i promise that you'll never be lonely""
and ever since that day
i am a lost boy from neverland
usually hanging out with peter pan
and when we're bored, we play in the woods
always on the run from captain hook
""run, run lost boy,"" they say to me
away from all of reality
neverland is home to lost boys like me
and lost boys like me are free
neverland is home to lost boys like me
and lost boys like me are free
he sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
believe in him and believe in me
together we will fly away in a cloud of green
to your beautiful destiny
as we soared above the town that never loved me
i realized i finally had a family
soon enough, we reached neverland
peacefully, my feet hit the sand
and ever since that day
i am a lost boy from neverland
usually hanging out with peter pan
and when we're bored, we play in the woods
always on the run from captain hook
""run, run lost boy,"" they say to me
away from all of reality
neverland is home to lost boys like me
and lost boys like me are free
neverland is home to lost boys like me
and lost boys like me are free
peter pan, tinker bell, wendy darling
even captain hook, you are my perfect storybook
neverland, i love you so, you are now my home sweet home
forever a lost boy at last
peter pan, tinker bell, wendy darling
even captain hook, you are my perfect storybook
neverland, i love you so, you are now my home sweet home
forever a lost boy at last
and for always i will say…
i am a lost boy from neverland
usually hanging out with peter pan
and when we're bored, we play in the woods
always on the run from captain hook

We Don't Talk Anymore (feat. Selena Gomez),Charlie Puth,12353,"لم نعد نتحدث، لم نعد نتحدث

ما نوع الفستان الذي ترتديه الليلة

أن آتي وأظهر عند بابك
لكنني خائفة جدًا من أن معتقدي خاطىء

je vais enlever quelques étiquettes
avec seulement 20 dollars dans ma poche
j'suis, j'suis à la chasse, à la recherche de bonnes affaires
c'est vraiment énorme
là j'avance dans la discothèque en mode ""un problème ? j'ai une grosse bite !""
mais en fait j'suis juste excité car j'ai acheté quelques sapes au thrift shop
la glace sur les franges est tellement givrée
les gens sont genre ""putain, frais le beau-gosse""
j'arrive, m'enfonce, direction la mezzanine
vêtu tout de rose sauf mes chaussures en croco, qui sont vertes
je porte un vison de léopard, une fille est débout à côté de moi
j'ai probablement dû lavé ça, il sent comme les draps de r. kelly
(pisse)
mais putain, ça coutait 99 cents
je m'en fous, je le porte, je le lave, je suis sur le point de sortir et me faire complimenter
je laisse passer ces mocassins dans lesquels quelqu'un d'autre a marché
en mode clodo et grunge, rien à foutre, je crâne et je me la pète et
j'économise et je suis putain d'heureux, ça c'est une affaire, pute
j'vais piquer le style de ton grand-père, j'vais piquer le style de ton grand-père
non, en vrai, demande à ton grand-père : ""j'peux récupérer ses vieilles sapes?""
(merci !)
combinaison en velours et des chaussons d'intérieur
veste en cuir marron-merde que j'ai trouvé en fouillant
ils avaient un clavier cassé, j'ai acheté un clavier cassé
j'ai acheté une couverture à foutre, puis j'ai acheté un kneeboard

A Thousand Years,Christina Perri,12216,"heart beats fast, colors and promises
how to be brave? how can i love when i'm afraid to fall?
but watching you stand alone
all of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
one step closer
i have died every day waiting for you
darling, don't be afraid
i have loved you for a thousand years
i'll love you for a thousand more
time stands still, beauty in all she is
i will be brave, i will not let anything take away
what's standing in front of me
every breath, every hour has come to this
one step closer
i have died every day waiting for you
darling, don't be afraid
i have loved you for a thousand years
i'll love you for a thousand more
and all along, i believed i would find you
time has brought your heart to me
i have loved you for a thousand years
i'll love you for a thousand more
one step closer
one step closer
i have died every day waiting for you
darling, don't be afraid
i have loved you for a thousand years
i'll love you for a thousand more

Stairway To Heaven,Led Zeppelin,12202,"there's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
and she's buying a stairway to heaven
when she gets there, she knows if the stores are all closed
with a word, she can get what she came for
ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven
there's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
in a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
ooh, it makes me wonder
ooh, makes me wonder
there's a feeling i get when i look to the west
and my spirit is crying for leaving
in my thoughts, i have seen rings of smoke through the trees
and the voices of those who stand looking
ooh, it makes me wonder
ooh, really makes me wonder
and it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
then the piper will lead us to reason
and a new day will dawn for those who stand long
and the forests will echo with laughter
oh-oh-oh-oh-woah-ho
if there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
it's just a spring clean for the may queen
yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
there's still time to change the road you're on
and it makes me wonder
ohh, oh-oh
your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
the piper's calling you to join him
dear lady, can you hear the wind blow?
and did you know
your stairway lies on the whispering wind? oh
and as we wind on down the road
our shadows taller than our soul
there walks a lady we all know
who shines white light and wants to show
how everything still turns to gold
and if you listen very hard
the tune will come to you at last
when all are one, and one is all, yeah
to be a rock and not to roll
and she's buying a stairway to heaven"

we don't need to
we got everything we need right here and everything we need is enough
just so easy when
the whole world fits inside of your arms
do we really need to pay attention to the alarm?
wake up slow, mmm-mmm, wake up slow
but baby
you hardly even notice when i try to show you this
song, it's meant to keep you from doing what you're supposed to
like waking up too early, maybe we could sleep in
make you banana pancakes, pretend like it's the weekend now

Knee Deep (feat. Jimmy Buffett),Zac Brown Band,11827,"going to put the the world away for a minute
pretend i don't live in it
sunshine going to wash my blues away
had sweet love but i lost it
she got too close so i fought it
now i'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way
wishing i was knee deep in the water somewhere
got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair
only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
never been so happy
never felt so high
and i think i might have found me my own kind of paradise
wrote a note said be back in a minute
bought a boat and i sailed off in it
don't think anybody's going to miss me anyway
mind on a permanent vacation
the ocean is my only medication
wishing my condition ain't ever going to go away
now i'm knee deep in the water somewhere
got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
never been so happy
never felt so high
and i think i might have found me my own kind of paradise
this champagne shore washing over me
it's a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea
one day you could be as lost as me
change your geography
maybe you might be
knee deep in the water somewhere
got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
never been so happy
never felt so high
and i think i might have found me my own kind of paradise

find yourself a little slice
grab a back, pack it light
you never know until you try
when you lose yourself
you find the key to paradise"

YOUTH,Troye Sivan,11717,"what if, what if we run away?
what if, what if we left today?
what if we said goodbye to safe and sound?
and what if, what if we're hard to find?
what if, what if we lost our minds?
what if we let them fall behind and they're never found?
and when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
and the stars exploding, we'll be fireproof
my youth, my youth is yours
trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
my youth, my youth is yours
runaway now and forevermore
my youth, my youth is yours
a truth so loud you can't ignore
my youth, my youth, my youth
my youth is yours
what if, what if we start to drive?
what if, what if we close our eyes?
what if we're speeding through red lights into paradise?
cause we've no time for getting old
mortal body; timeless souls
cross your fingers, here we go
and when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
and the stars exploding, we'll be fireproof
my youth, my youth is yours
trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
my youth, my youth is yours
runaway now and forevermore
my youth, my youth is yours
a truth so loud you can't ignore
my youth, my youth, my youth
my youth is yours

Break Up In A Small Town,Sam Hunt,11532,"i knew i'd see her around
i'd be at some party, she'd show up and i'd be walkin' out
or across some parking lot, hidin' behind her sister
i'd look up, and she'd be at the red light beside me
in that white maxima with the sticker on the back
i'd act like i didn't see her
we'd pay at the same pumps
flip through the same stations
and slow down for the same curves
run around with the same crowds
we just needed some time
she could get on with her life and i'd get on with mine
thought i would be fine, heh, but maybe not
i knew she'd find a way to get over me
but i'd never thought
she would get down with somebody i know
i guess that's just how it goes when you break up in a small town
i see our friends and they put on a show
like they don't want me to know
so they give me the go-around
but there's only so many streets, so many lights
i swear it's like i can't even leave my house
i should've known all along
you gotta move or move on
when you break up in a small town
for a while i guess they were keeping it low-key
but now it's like these county lines, closin' in on me
i see 'em everywhere together
and it's hittin' a little too close to home
she's so far gone, but she didn't go far
she was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
she's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard
in someone else's arms, right down the road
and i never thought
she would get down with somebody i know
i guess that's just how it goes when you break up in a small town
i see our friends and they put on a show
like they don't want me to know
so they give me the go-around
but there's only so many streets, so many lights
i swear it's like i can't even leave my house
i should've known all along
you gotta move or move on
when you break up in a small town
her mailbox is seven minutes from mine
and i drive into town, sometimes and i see you sittin' there with him
and i wanna jump out, i wanna fight
i wanna say, ""**** that guy"" but i can't
it's my fault, i let her go
i never thought
that she would get down with somebody i know
i guess that's just how it goes when you break up in a small town
i see our friends and they put on a show
they don't want me to know

Love The Way You Lie,Eminem,11457,"just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
well, that's all right because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
well, that's all right because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i can't tell you what it really is, i can only tell you what it feels like
and right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
i can't breathe, but i still fight while i can fight
as long as the wrong feels right, it's like i'm in flight
high off of love, drunk from my hate
it's like i'm huffin' paint and i love her, the more i suffer, i suffocate
and right before i'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
she fuckin' hates me, and i love it — ""wait
where you going?"" — ""i'm leaving you"" — ""no, you ain't
come back"" — we're runnin' right back, here we go again
it's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
i'm superman with the wind at his back, she's lois lane
but when it's bad, it's awful, i feel so ashamed
i snapped, ""who's that dude?"", i don't even know his name
i laid hands on her, i'll never stoop so low again
i guess i don't know my own strength
just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
well, that's all right because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
well, that's all right because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
you ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
you meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
you swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
now you're in each other's face
spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
you push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
throw 'em down, pin 'em
so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
it's the rage that's the culprit, it controls you both
so they say you're best to go your separate ways
guess that they don't know ya
'cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
it's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
but you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
you don't get another chance, life is no nintendo game
but you lied again
now you get to watch her leave out the window
guess that's why they call it window pane
just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
well, that's all right because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
well, that's all right because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
now, i know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
and we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
but your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby, please
come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
all i know is i love you too much to walk away though
come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
don't you hear sincerity in my voice when i talk?
told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
next time i'm pissed, i'll aim my fist at the drywall
next time? there won't be no next time!
i apologize, even though i know it's lies
i'm tired of the games, i just want her back, i know i'm a liar
if she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, i'ma tie her
to the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—
just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
well, that's all right because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
well, that's all right because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie"

you were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
i mean, i write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
your natural hair and your soft skin and your big ass in that sundress, ooh

the webs from all the spiders
catching things and eating their insides

and hear your voice of treason
will you come home and stop this pain tonight?

yesterday i thought i saw your shadow running round
it's funny how things never change in this old town
so far from the stars
and i want to tell you everything
the words i never got to say the first time around
and i remember everything
from when we were the children playing in this fairground
wish i was there with you now
if the whole world was watching i'd still dance with you
drive highways and byways to be there with you
over and over the only truth
everything comes back to you
i saw that you moved on with someone new
in the pub that we met he's got his arms around you
it's so hard
so hard
and i want to tell you everything
the words i never got to say the first time around
and i remember everything
from when we were the children playing in this fairground
wish i was there with you now
because if the whole world was watching i'd still dance with you
drive highways and byways to be there with you
over and over the only truth
everything comes back to you
you still make me nervous when you walk in the room
them butterflies they come alive when i'm next to you
over and over the only truth
everything comes back to you
and i know that it's wrong
that i can't move on
but there's something about you

that planet earth turns slowly

'cause everything is never as it seems

as they tried to teach me how to dance
a foxtrot above my head, a sock hop beneath my bed
a disco ball is just hanging by a thread

i got misty eyes as they said farewell (they said farewell)
but i'll know where several are if my dreams get real bizarre

tomorrow, some new building will scrape the sky
i love this country dearly, i can feel the ladder clearly
but i never thought i'd be alone to try
once, i was outside penn station selling red and white carnations
we were still alone, my wife and i
before we married, saved my money, brought my dear wife over
now i work to bring my family stateside
but off the boat, they stayed a while, then scattered across the coast
once a year i'll see them for a week or so at most
i took a walk
take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
take a walk, take a walk, take a walk (oh)
i took a walk
take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
take a walk, take a walk, take a walk (oh)
practice isn't perfect, but the market cuts a loss
i remind myself that times could be much worse
my wife won't ask me questions, there's not so much to ask
and she'll never flaunt around an empty purse
once, my mother-in-law came just to stay a couple nights
then decided she would stay the rest of her life
i watch my little children play some board game in the kitchen
and i sit and pray they never feel my strife
but then my partner called to say the pension funds were gone
he made some bad investments, now the accounts are overdrawn
i took a walk
take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
take a walk, take a walk, take a walk (oh)
i took a walk
take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
take a walk, take a walk, take a walk (oh)
honey, it's your son, i think i borrowed just too much
we had taxes, we had bills, we had a lifestyle to front
and, tonight, i swear i'll come home and we'll make love like we're young
tomorrow, you'll cook dinner for the neighbors and their kids
we can rip apart those socialists and all their damn taxes
but see i am no criminal, i'm down on both bad knees
i'm just too much a coward to admit when i'm in need
i took a walk
take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
take a walk, take a walk, take a walk (oh)
i took a walk
take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
take a walk, take a walk, take a walk (oh)
i took a walk
take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
take a walk, take a walk, take a walk (oh)
i took a walk
take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
take a walk, take a walk, take a walk (oh)"
Springsteen,Eric Church,11157,"to this day when i hear that song
i see you standin' there on that lawn
discount shades, store bought tan
flip flops and cut-off jeans
somewhere between that setting sun
""i'm on fire"" and ""born to run""
you looked at me, and i was done
but we were just getting started
i was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
i was so alive, never been more free
fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang, ""oh""
stayed there 'til they forced us out
and took the long way to your house
i can still hear the sound of you sayin', ""don't go""
when i think about you, i think about 17
i think about my old jeep
i think about the stars in the sky
funny how a melody sounds like a memory
like the soundtrack to a july saturday night
springsteen
i bumped into you by happenstance
you probably wouldn't even know who i am
but if i whispered your name i bet there'd still be a spark
back when i was gasoline
and this old tattoo had brand new ink
and we didn't care what your mom would think
about your name on my arm
baby, is it spring or is it summer?
the guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
you hear sometimes late at night
on your radio
even though you're a million miles away
when you hear ""born in the usa""
do you relive those glory days
so long ago?
when you think about me, do you think about 17?
do you think about my old jeep?
think about the stars in the sky?
funny how a melody sounds like a memory
like a soundtrack to a july saturday night

Someone Like You,Adele,11119,"i heard that you're settled down
that you found a girl and you're married now
i heard that your dreams came true
guess she gave you things i didn't give to you
old friend, why are you so shy?
ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
i hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
but i couldn't stay away, i couldn't fight it
i had hoped you'd see my face
and that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
never mind, i'll find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you, too
don't forget me, i beg
i remember you said
sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
you know how the time flies
only yesterday was the time of our lives
we were born and raised in a summer haze
bound by the surprise of our glory days
i hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
but i couldn't stay away, i couldn't fight it
i had hoped you'd see my face
and that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
never mind, i'll find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you, too
don't forget me, i beg
i remember you said
sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
nothing compares, no worries or cares
regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
never mind, i'll find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you
don't forget me, i beg
i remember you said
sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
never mind, i'll find someone like you

Scars To Your Beautiful,Alessia Cara,10976,"she just wants to be beautiful
she goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
she craves attention, she praises an image
she prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
oh, she don't see the light that's shinin'
deeper than the eyes can find it
maybe we have made her blind
so she tries to cover up her pain
and cut her woes away
'cause covergirls don't cry
after their face is made
but
there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
you should know you're beautiful just the way you are
and you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
no scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
oh-oh-oh
oh-oh-oh-oh
and you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
no scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
she has dreams to be an envy, so she's
starving, you know, covergirls eat nothin'
she says, ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything, what's a little bit of hunger?
i can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
she don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh

slowly sinking, wasting
crumbling like pastries

ripped gloves, raincoat
tried to swim and stay afloat

loose change, banknotes

Some Nights,fun.,10738,"some nights, i stay up cashin' in my bad luck
some nights, i call it a draw
some nights, i wish that my lips could build a castle
some nights, i wish they'd just fall off
but i still wake up, i still see your ghost
oh, lord, i'm still not sure what i stand for, oh
(oh-ooh, oh, oh) what do i stand for?
(oh-ooh, oh, oh) what do i stand for?
most nights, i don't know anymore
oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh
oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh
oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh
oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh
this is it, boys, this is war
(oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh)
what are we waiting for?
(oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
why don't we break the rules already?
i was never one to believe the hype
(oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh)
save that for the black and white
(oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
try twice as hard, and i'm half as liked
but here they come again to jack my style
and that's all right (that's all right)
i found a martyr in my bed tonight
she stops my bones from wondering
just who i, who i, who i
am, oh, who am i? mm-mm
mm-mm
well, some nights, i wish that this all would end
'cause i could use some friends for a change
and some nights, i'm scared you'll forget me again
some nights, i always win (i always win)
but i still wake up, i still see your ghost
oh, lord, i'm still not sure what i stand for, oh
(oh-ooh, oh, oh) what do i stand for?
(oh-ooh, oh, oh) what do i stand for?
most nights, i don't know
(oh, come on) so this is it?
i sold my soul for this?
washed my hands of that for this?
i miss my mom and dad for this?
(oh, come on) no, when i see stars, when i see
when i see stars, that's all they are
when i hear songs, they sound like a swan
so come on, oh, come on
oh, come on, oh, come on
well, that is it, guys, that is all
(oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh)
five minutes in, and i'm bored again
(oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
ten years of this, i'm not sure if anybody understands
this one is not for the folks at home
(oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh)
sorry to leave, mom, i had to go
(oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
who the fuck wants to die alone
all dried up in the desert sun?
my heart is breakin' for my sister
and the con that she called ""love""
and then i look into my nephew's eyes
man, you wouldn't believe
the most amazing things
that can come from
some terrible nights
ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah (all right, come on)
oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh
oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh
oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh
oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh
the other night, you wouldn't believe
the dream i just had about you and me
i'd called you up, but we both agreed
it's for the best you didn't listen, no
it's for the best we get our distance, oh-oh-oh
for the best, you didn't listen
it's for the best we get our distance, oh-oh-oh-oh"
Somebody That I Used To Know,Gotye,10726,"now and then, i think of when we were together
like when you said you felt so happy, you could die
i told myself that you were right for me
but felt so lonely in your company
but that was love and it's an ache i still remember
you can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
like resignation to the end, always the end
so when we found that we could not make sense
well, you said that we would still be friends
but i'll admit that i was glad it was over
but you didn't have to cut me off
make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
and i don't even need your love
but you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
no, you didn't have to stoop so low
have your friends collect your records and then change your number
i guess that i don't need that, though
now you're just somebody that i used to know
now you're just somebody that i used to know
now you're just somebody that i used to know
now and then, i think of all the times you screwed me over
but had me believing it was always something that i'd done
but i don't wanna live that way
reading into every word you say
you said that you could let it go
and i wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know
but you didn't have to cut me off
make out like it never happened and that we were nothing (ah)
and i don't even need your love (ohh)
but you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough (ah)
no, you didn't have to stoop so low (ohh)
have your friends collect your records and then change your number (ah)

you persecute the weak
because it makes you feel so strong (
safe

don't have much strength to fight
so i look to the light (
war

to make these wrongs turn right
head up high, i look to the light
hey, 'cause i know that you'll make everything alright
and i know that you'll take good care of your child
oh, no longer am afraid of the night
'cause i, i look to the light
when they come for you, i will shield your name
i will field their questions, i will feel your pain
no one can judge
they don't, they don't know
they don't know
foot on the devil's neck 'til it drifted, pangaea
i'm moving all my family from chatham to zambia
treat the demons just like pam
i mean, i fuck with your friends, but damn, gina
i been this way since arthur was anteater
now they wanna hit me with the woo wap, the bam
tryna snap photos of familia
my daughter look just like sia, you can't see her
you can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
i made ""sunday candy,"" i'm never going to hell
i met kanye west, i'm never going to fail
he said, ""let's do a good ass job with '
chance 3

i hear you gotta sell it to snatch the grammy
let's make it so free and the bars so hard
that there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
this is my part, nobody else speak
this is my part, nobody else speak
this little light of mine
glory be to god, yeah
i'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
if they don't wanna ride, i'ma still give 'em raincoats
know what god said when he made the first rainbow
just throw this at the end if i'm too late for the intro
ugh, i'm just having fun with it
you know that a nigga was lost
i laugh in my head
'cause i bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt

i'm so full of love, i could barely eat
there's nothin' sweeter than my baby
i'd never want once from the cherry tree

she'd give me toothaches just from kissin' me
when my time comes around
lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
no grave can hold my body down
i'll crawl home to her

i was three days on a drunken sin
i woke with her walls around me
nothin' in her room but an empty crib
and i was burnin' up a fever
i didn't care much how long i lived
but i swear, i thought i dreamed her
she never asked me once about the wrong i did
when my time comes around
lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
no grave can hold my body down
i'll crawl home to her
when my time comes around
lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
no grave can hold my body down
i'll crawl home to her
my babe would never fret none
about what my hands and my body done
if the lord don't forgive me
i'd still have my baby and my babe would have me
when i was kissin' on my baby
and she put her love down, soft and sweet
in the low lamplight, i was free
heaven and hell were words to me
when my time comes around
lay me gently in the cold, dark earth
no grave can hold my body down

The Cave,Mumford & Sons,10460,"it's empty in the valley of your heart
the sun, it rises slowly as you walk
away from all the fears
and all the faults you've left behind
the harvest left no food for you to eat
you cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
but i have seen the same
i know the shame in your defeat
but i will hold on hope
and i won't let you choke
on the noose around your neck
and i'll find strength in pain
and i will change my ways
i'll know my name as it's called again
'cause i have other things to fill my time
you take what is yours and i'll take mine
now let me at the truth
which will refresh my broken mind
so tie me to a post and block my ears
i can see widows and orphans through my tears
i know my call despite my faults
and despite my growing fears
but i will hold on hope
and i won't let you choke
on the noose around your neck
and i'll find strength in pain
and i will change my ways
i'll know my name as it's called again
so come out of your cave walking on your hands
and see the world hanging upside down
you can understand dependence
when you know the maker's land
so make your siren's call
and sing all you want
i will not hear what you have to say
'cause i need freedom now
and i need to know how
to live my life as it's meant to be
and i will hold on hope
and i won't let you choke
on the noose around your neck
and i'll find strength in pain
and i will change my ways
i'll know my name as it's called again"

Car Radio,Twenty One Pilots,10367,"i ponder of something great
my lungs will fill and then deflate
they fill with fire, exhale desire
i know it's dire, my time today
i have these thoughts so often, i ought
to replace that slot with what i once bought
'cause somebody stole my car radio
and now i just sit in silence
sometimes quiet is violent
i find it hard to hide it, my pride is no longer inside
it's on my sleeve, my skin will scream
reminding me of who i killed inside my dream
i hate this car that i'm driving, there's no hiding for me
i'm forced to deal with what i feel
there is no distraction to mask what is real
i could pull the steering wheel
i have these thoughts so often, i ought
to replace that slot with what i once bought
'cause somebody stole my car radio
and now i just sit in silence
i ponder of something terrifying
'cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
i find over the course of our human existence
one thing consists of consistence
and it's that we're all battling fear
oh dear, i don't know if we know why we're here
oh my, too deep, please stop thinking
i liked it better when my car had sound
there are things we can do
but from the things that work there are only two
and-a from the two that we choose to do
peace will win and fear will lose
and there's faith and there's sleep
we need to pick one, please, because
faith is to be awake and to be awake is for us to think
and for us to think is to be alive
and i will try with every rhyme
to come across like i am dying
to let you know you need to try to think
i have these thoughts so often, i ought
to replace that slot with what i once bought
'cause somebody stole my car radio
and now i just sit in silence

remembering all the times you fought with me
i'm surprised it got so far
things aren't the way they were before

Weekend (feat. Miguel),Mac Miller,10298,"tô com um troco no bolso, me sentindo dono do pedaço
meu corpo lotado de toxina, já fui de coração partido, foda-se essa mina
fumo pra lidar com os problemas, transo e bebo pra esquecer
mas essas mina são mó enjoadas, mesmo assim, eu curto o rolê
dias longos, noites mais ainda, falo demais, ouço conselho ruim, cheio de luz em volta da minha vida
doutor, doutor, cê pode me ajudar? me manter suave, quieto, onde o inferno tá
ninguém tem nada pra me dizer agora, foda-se esse rap, tô vendendo show, lotando a porra toda
tô com minha nova mina, agora tu tá com inveja, né?! chapando em casa vendo belly na tv (sim)
toda dor que causaram, tanto faz, tô vencendo, tudo certo enfim
tô sentindo o momento, tranquilo, só vivendo, queimando esse estresse em mim
conversas me pesando, já é demais pra mim
senhor, preciso de um respiro, um fim
mas eu vou tá bem até o fim de semana (tudo certo)
eu vou tá bem até o fim de semana (yeah)
tudo vai tá bem até o fim de semana (certo)
tudo vai ficar bem até o fim de semana (até o fim de semana)
a gente vai sair hoje, foda-se
a gente vai sair hoje, foda-se
a gente vai sair hoje (é o fim de semana)
a gente vai sair hoje (é o fim de semana)
tô tendo dificuldade pra dormir, lutando com meus demônios
pensando no que me mantém vivo, é o dinheiro, a fama, ou nenhum dos dois?
penso nos lugares por onde passo, nas pessoas que vejo
tô só tentando viver decente, mas o que é ""ser um g""?
e o tempo todo, a gente se perde, várias mina no meu caminho, mas chamo de ""minha"", loucura
pelo desejo de deus, transformo água em vinho, pauso o tempo, normal, eles me odeiam sempre
nunca andei na linha, cruzo os ""t"", ponto os ""i"", pensando, tipo: ""como cheguei tão alto?"", dormi e esqueci de morrer, caralho
tomo calmante e bebo pó, frito
compro sem receita, preso na tela, pensando ""como cheguei aqui?""
essas mina nem me conhecem, essa vida é solitária, até ela tirar a roupa
nem sei mais que dia é hoje
mas eu vou tá bem até o fim de semana (tudo certo)
eu vou tá bem até o fim de semana (yeah)
tudo vai tá bem até o fim de semana (certo)
tudo vai ficar bem até o fim de semana (até o fim de semana)
na segunda eu penso em você, mas nem piro com isso
na terça, te ligo, preciso te ver de novo
na quarta, tô contigo, e você dorme aqui
na quinta, já cansei de você, preciso sumir
porque sexta é o começo da minha vida, yeah
quando eu fico chapado, cê odeia, mas, amor
vai ficar tudo bem
haha, tudo bem"

when you're ready, just say you're ready
when all the baggage just ain't as heavy
and the party's over, just don't forget me
we'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
you won't ever have to worry
you won't ever have to hide
and you've seen all my mistakes

one time, been in love one time
you and all your girls in the club one time
all so convinced that you're followin' your heart
'cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
we all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
i've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
you hate bein' alone, well, you ain't the only one
you hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
you love your friends, but somebody should've told you somethin'
to save you, instead, they say
don't, tell me, i don't care if you hurt
i don't, tell you, you don't care if you're true

oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
wanted to receive attention for my music
wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
for wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways

abused ink, used it as a tool when i blew steam
woo! hit the lottery, ooh-wee
but with what i gave up to get it was bittersweet
it was like winnin' a used mink
ironic 'cause i think i'm gettin' so huge i need a shrink

just wakin' up in the mornin', gotta thank god
i don't know, but today seems kinda odd
no barkin' from the dog, no smog
and mama cooked the breakfast with no hog (damn)
i got my grub on, but didn't pig out
finally got a call from a girl i wanna dig out (what's up?)
hooked it up for later as i hit the door
thinkin', ""will i live another twenty-four?""
i gotta go 'cause i got me a drop-top
and if i hit the switch, i can make the ass drop
had to stop at a red light
lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight
and everything is alright
i got a beep from kim, and she can fuck all night
called up the homies and i'm askin' y'all
""which park are y'all playin' basketball?""
get me on the court and i'm trouble
last week, fucked around and got a triple-double
freakin' niggas every way like mj
i can't believe today was a good day (shit)
drove to the pad and hit the showers
didn't even get no static from the cowards
'cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
saw the police and they rolled right past me
no flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
as i ran the intersection
went to short dog's house, they was watchin'
yo! mtv raps
what's the haps on the craps?
shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
roll 'em in a circle of niggas
and watch me break 'em with the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven
seven, even back door little joe
i picked up the cash flow
then we played bones, and i'm yellin', ""domino""
plus nobody i know got killed in south central l.a.​
today was a good day (shit)
left my nigga's house paid (word)
picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
it's ironic, i had the brew, she had the chronic
the lakers beat the supersonics
i felt on the big fat fanny
pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
and my dick runs deep, so deep
so deep, put her ass to sleep
woke her up around one
she didn't hesitate to call ice cube the top gun (yeah)
drove her to the pad and i'm coastin'
took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
i was glad everything had worked out (uh)
dropped her ass off and then chirped out
today was like one of those fly dreams
didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
no helicopter lookin' for a murder
two in the mornin', got the fatburger
even saw the lights of the goodyear blimp
and it read, ""ice cube's a pimp"" (yeah)
drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
halfway home and my pager still blowin' up

Reflections,MisterWives,9645,"you didn't close the door
left a crack open, i couldn't ignore
the faint possibility
of having hope in this insanity
that we still could be
but we're stuck floating in between
put me on the shelf, discipline myself
to let the sparks die out
shattering anything
that has reflections of you
you, you, you
our eyes were closed with hearts open wide
dismissed every rule to abide by
our bodies undressed the layers of shy
revealing the truth that was buried inside
filled up of feelings
that now are bursting at the seams
put me on the shelf, discipline myself
to let the sparks die out
shattering anything
that has reflections of you
you, you, you
unsure of what are my dreams, it seems
you've stolen my slumber and awakened another
life within me that is better than any other
reaching endless heights in never-ending nights
that can't be seen, put to bed this dream
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
put me on the shelf, discipline myself
to let the sparks die out
shattering anything
that has reflections of you

Welcome to the Black Parade,My Chemical Romance,9638,"when i was a young boy, my father
took me into the city to see a marching band
he said, ""son, when you grow up, would you be
the savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned?""
he said, ""will you defeat them, your demons
and all the non-believers, the plans that they have made?
because one day, i'll leave you a phantom
to lead you in the summer to join the black parade""
when i was a young boy, my father
took me into the city to see a marching band
he said, ""son, when you grow up, would you be
the savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned?""
sometimes, i get the feeling she's watching over me
and other times, i feel like i should go
and through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
and when you're gone, we want you all to know
we'll carry on, we'll carry on
and though you're dead and gone, believe me
your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
and in my heart, i can't contain it
the anthem won't explain it
a world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
your misery and hate will kill us all
so paint it black and take it back, and let's shout it loud and clear
defiant to the end, we hear the call
to carry on, we'll carry on
and though you're dead and gone, believe me
your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
and though you're broken and defeated
your weary widow marches
on and on, we carry through the fears (oh, ha, ha)
disappointed faces of your peers (oh, ha, ha)
take a look at me, 'cause i could not care at all
do or die, you'll never make me
because the world will never take my heart
go and try, you'll never break me
we want it all, we wanna play this part
i won't explain or say i'm sorry
i'm unashamed, i'm gonna show my scar
and give a cheer for all the broken
listen here, because it's who we are
just a man, i'm not a hero
just a boy who had to sing this song
just a man, i'm not a hero
i don't care
we'll carry on, we'll carry on
and though you're dead and gone, believe me
your memory will carry on, you'll carry on
and though you're broken and defeated
your weary widow marches on
do or die, you'll never make me
because the world will never take my heart
go and try, you'll never break me

jagged vacance, thick with ice

was where we learned to celebrate
automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
that night you played me ""lip parade""
not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
saying nothing, that's enough for me

hulled far from the highway aisle
jagged vacance, thick with ice

above my brother, i, and tangled spines
we smoked the screen to make it what it was to be
now, to know it in my memory

married with a lack of vision

you're as warm as a glass of brandy

for if the dark returns, then my brothers will die

calls of guilty thrown at me, all while she stains
the sheets of some other
thrown at me so powerfully, just like she throws
with the arm of her brother
but i want it, it's a crime
that she's not around most of the time
the way she shows me i'm hers and she is mine
open hand or closed fist, oh, would be fine
the blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine
her fight and fury's fiery
oh, but she loves like sleep to the freezing
sweet and right and merciful, i'm all but washed
in the tide of her breathing
and it's worth it, it's divine
i have this some of the time
the way she shows me i'm hers and she is mine

Remember The Name (feat. Styles Of Beyond),Fort Minor,9385,"you ready? let's go!
yeah!
for those of you that wanna know what we're all about
it's like this, y'all, c'mon!
this is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
fifteen percent concentrated power of will
five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
and a hundred percent reason to remember the name (mike!)
he doesn't need his name up in lights
he just wants to be heard, whether it's the beat or the mic
he feels so unlike everybody else, alone
in spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
but fuck 'em, he knows the code, it's not about the salary
it's all about reality and making some noise
making a story, making sure his clique stays up
that means when he puts it down, tak's picking it up, let's go
who the hell is he, anyway? he never really talks much
never concerned with status but still leaving 'em star-struck
humbled through opportunities given despite the fact
that many misjudge him 'cause he makes a living from writing raps
put it together himself, now the picture connects
never asking for someone's help (help), or to get some respect ('spect)
he's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
and now it all unfolds the skill of an artist
this is twenty percent skill (uh), eighty percent beer
be a hundred percent clear, 'cause ryu is ill (next)
who would've thought he'd be the one to set the west in flames
then i heard him wreck it with the crystal method ""name of the game"" (uh-huh)
came back, dropped ""megadef,"" took 'em to church
i like ""bleach"", man, ryu had the stupidest verse (ha-ha)
this dude is the truth, now, everybody giving him guest spots
his stock's through the roof, i heard he fucking with s. dot
this is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
fifteen percent concentrated power of will
five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
and a hundred percent reason to remember the name
they call him ryu the sick, and he's spitting fire with mike
got him out the dryer, he's hot, found him in fort minor with tak
what a fucking nihilist, porcupine, he's a prick, he's a cock
the type women wanna be with and rappers hope he gets shot
eight years in the making, patiently waiting to blow
now, the record with shinoda's taking over the globe
he's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope
you won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat
tak, he's not your everyday on the block
he knows how to work with what he's got, making his way to the top
he often gets a comment on his name, people keep asking him
""was it given at birth or does it stand for an acronym?""
no, he's living proof (proof), got him rocking the booth
he'll get you buzzing quicker than a shot of vodka with juice (juice)
him and his crew are known around as one of the best
dedicated to what they do and give a hundred percent
forget mike, nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
it seems like he's never got time
because he writes every note and he writes every line
and i've seen him at work, when that light goes on in his mind
it's like a design is written in his head, every time
before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
and those motherfuckers he runs with, the kids that he signed?
ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it?
this is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
fifteen percent concentrated power of will
five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
and a hundred percent reason to remember the name
this is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
fifteen percent concentrated power of will
five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
and a hundred percent reason to remember the name
yeah! fort minor, m. shinoda, styles of beyond

and to the fans, i'll never let you down again, i'm back
i promise to never go back on that promise
in fact, let's be honest, that last
relapse
cd was ""ehh""
perhaps i ran them accents into the ground
relax, i ain't goin' back to that now
all i'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow
'cause i ain't playin' around
there's a game called circle and i don't know how
i'm way too up to back down
but i think i'm still tryna figure this crap out
thought i had it mapped out, but i guess i didn't
this fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
but it's time to exorcise these demons
these motherfuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
i'm not afraid, i'm not afraid
to take a stand, to take a stand
everybody, everybody
come take my hand, come take my hand
we'll walk this road together, through the storm
whatever weather, cold or warm
just lettin' you know that you're not alone
holla if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road, same road)
and i just can't keep livin' this way
so startin' today
i'm breakin' out of this cage
i'm standin' up, i'ma face my demons
i'm mannin' up, i'ma hold my ground
i've had enough, now i'm so fed up
time to put my life back together right now
it was my decision to get clean, i did it for me
admittedly i probably did it subliminally for you
so i could come back a brand-new me, you helped see me through
and don't even realize what you did, believe me, you
i've been through the wringer
but they can do little to the middle finger
i think i got a tear in my eye, i feel like the king of
my world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
and drop dead: no more beef lingers
no more drama from now on
i promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
so i solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'cause the way i feel, i'm strong enough to go to the club
or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'cause i'm raisin' the bar, i'd shoot for the moon
but i'm too busy gazin' at stars, i feel amazin', and
i'm not afraid, i'm not afraid
to take a stand, to take a stand
everybody, everybody
come take my hand, come take my hand
we'll walk this road together, through the storm
whatever weather, cold or warm
just lettin' you know that you're not alone
holla if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road, same-)"
When You Were Young,The Killers,9314,"you sit there in your heartache
waiting on some beautiful boy to
to save you from your old ways
you play forgiveness; watch it now, here he comes
he doesn't look a thing like jesus
but he talks like a gentleman
like you imagined
when you were young
can we climb this mountain? i don't know
higher now than ever before
i know we can make it if we take it slow
let's take it easy, easy now, watch it go
we're burning down the highway skyline
on the back of a hurricane that started turnin'
when you were young
when you were young
and sometimes you close your eyes
and see the place where you used to live
when you were young
they say the devil's water, it ain't so sweet
you don't have to drink right now
but you can dip your feet
every once in a little while
you sit there in your heartache
waiting on some beautiful boy to
to save you from your old ways
you play forgiveness; watch it now, here he comes
he doesn't look a thing like jesus
but he talks like a gentleman
like you imagined
when you were young
(

"You're Gonna Go Far, Kid",The Offspring,9310,"show me how to lie, you're getting better all the time
and turning all against the one is an art that's hard to teach
another clever word sets off an unsuspecting herd
and as you step back in the line, a mob jumps to their feet
now dance, fucker, dance, man, he never had a chance
and no one even knew it was really only you
and now you steal away, take him out today
nice work you did, you're gonna go far, kid
with a thousand lies and a good disguise
hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes
when you walk away, nothing more to say
see the lightning in your eyes, see 'em running for their lives
slowly outta line and drifting closer in your sight
so play it out, i'm wide-awake, it's a scene about me
there's something in your way and now someone is gonna pay
and if you can't get what you want, well, it's all because of me
now dance, fucker, dance, man, i never had a chance
and no one even knew it was really only you
and now you lead the way, show the light of day
nice work you did, you're gonna go far, kid (trust deceived)
with a thousand lies and a good disguise
hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes
when you walk away, nothing more to say
see the lightning in your eyes, see 'em running for their lives
now dance, fucker, dance, he never had a chance
and no one even knew it was really only you
and so dance, fucker, dance, i never had a chance
it was really only you
with a thousand lies and a good disguise
hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes
when you walk away, nothing more to say
see the lightning in your eyes, see 'em running for their lives

I Will Follow You Into The Dark,Death Cab for Cutie,9252,"love of mine, someday you will die
but i'll be close behind, i'll follow you into the dark
no blinding light or tunnels to gates of white
just our hands clasped so tight, waiting for the hint of a spark
if heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied
illuminate the ""no""s on their vacancy signs
if there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
then i'll follow you into the dark
in catholic school, as vicious as roman rule
i got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
and i held my tongue as she told me, ""son
fear is the heart of love,"" so i never went back
if heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied
illuminate the ""no""s on their vacancy signs
if there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
then i'll follow you into the dark
you and me have seen everything to see
from bangkok to calgary and the soles of your shoes
are all worn down, the time for sleep is now
but it's nothing to cry about 'cause we'll hold each other soon
in the blackest of rooms
and if heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied
and illuminate the ""no""s on their vacancy signs
if there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
then i'll follow you into the dark

""there are many here among us
who feel that life is but a joke, but, uh
but you and i, we've been through that
and this is not our fate
so let us stop talking falsely now
the hour's getting late, hey
hey
all along the watchtower
princes kept the view
while all the women came and went
barefoot servants too, well, uh
outside in the cold distance
a wildcat did growl
two riders were approaching
and the wind began to howl, hey

got to be a way, got to be a way out here

beautiful girl that i just met on tour
another good girl that i'll probably destroy
her life was stable until she met me
sheltered and safe, so she never gets freed
but she loves trouble, she's drawn to the danger

i could make her fall in love with a stranger
switch up the pace, i don't mean danny granger
can't wait until tomorrow? i'm fine with today
you pretty as fuck and i'm tryna slay
""let's do this right now"" is what i'm trying to say
i can tell you don't love him, you're dying to stray
i do not give a fuck 'bout your ex

i got a new attitude and a lease on life and some peace of mind
seek and i find, i can sleep when i die
want a piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
and shit i'm straight, i'm on my wave, i'm on my wave
get out my wake, i'm running late, what can i say?
i heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave
and the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name
so when i leave here on this earth, did i take more than i gave?
did i look out for the people, or did i do it all for fame?

trudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us

my grandma smiling down on me like ""woo, that boy got bars""
okay, okay, yes i do
i said amen and hallelujah, let me testify too

she'll see i'm not so tough

she'll understand what kind of guy i've been

Don't,Ed Sheeran,8848,"i met this girl late last year
she said, ""don't you worry if i disappear""
i told her, ""i'm not really looking for another mistake""
i called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
but then i jumped right in a week later, returned
i reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
but i gave her my time for two or three nights
then i put it on pause until the moment was right
i went away for months until our paths crossed again
she told me, ""i was never looking for a friend
maybe you could swing by my room around 10
baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
we'll be in between the sheets till the late am""
baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'
don't **** with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i don't wanna know that, babe
don't **** with my love
i told her, she knows
take aim and reload
i don't wanna know that, babe
and for a couple weeks, i only wanna see her
we drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
before, a text message was the only way to reach her
now she's stayin' at my place and loves the way i treat her
singing out aretha all over the track like a feature
and never wants to sleep, i guess that i don't want to either
but me and her, we make money the same way
four cities, two planes, the same day
and those shows have never been what it's about
but maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
i'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
but we should get on a plane or we'll be missin' it now
wish i'd have written it down, the way that things played out
when she was kissin' him, how i was confused about
now, she should figure it out while i'm sat here singing
don't **** with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i don't wanna know that, babe
don't **** with my love
i told her, she knows
take aim and reload
i don't wanna know that, babe
on my hotel door
i don't even know if she knows what for
she was cryin' on my shoulder, i already told ya
trust and respect is what we do this for
i never intended to be next (
get lost
)
but you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
and i never saw him as a threat (
get lost
)
until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
it's not like we were both on tour
we were stayin' on the same **** hotel floor
and i wasn't lookin' for a promise or commitment
but it was never just fun and i thought you were different
this is not the way you realised what you wanted
it's a bit too much, too late, if i'm honest
and all this time, god knows i'm singin'
don't **** with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i don't wanna know that, babe

miya hee, miya ho, miya hu, miya ha-ha
miya hee, miya ho, miya hu, miya ha-ha
ay... this a special what's happenin' to all my
all my soldiers over there in iraq
e'rybody right here
what you need to do is be thankful for the life you got, y'knowmsayin?
stop lookin' at what you ain't got
start bein' thankful for what you do got
let's give it to 'em baby girl, hey
you're gonna be, a shinin' star
in fancy clothes, and fancy cars
and then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
(rihanna, let's get it)
so live your life (ayy!) ayyy ayyy ayyy
you steady chasin' that paper
just live your life (ohh!) ayyy ayyy ayyy
ain't got no time for no haters

my life (ayy) my life (ohh)
just livin' my life (ayy) my life (ohh)
my life (ayy) my life (ohh) just livin' my life
hey, never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
amazing they ungrateful after all the game i gave away
safe to say i paved the way for you cats to get paid today
you'd still be wastin' days away now had i never saved the day
consider them my protege, homage i think they should pay
instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
i never been a hater, still, i love 'em in a crazy way
some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on labor day
it ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
i'm westside anyway, even if i left today and stayed away
some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
i brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
i pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
like i once made 'em spray, now i could make 'em put the k's away
been thuggin' all my life, can't say i don't deserve to take a break
you'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away
you're gonna be, a shinin' star
in fancy clothes, and fancy cars
and then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
(rihanna, let's get it)

just livin' my life (ayy) my life (ohh)
my life (ayy) my life (ohh) just livin' my life
i'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
the spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
articulate, but still i'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler tip
if that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow tip
i got love for the game, but ay i'm not in love with all of it
could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
the hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
and we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?
you're gonna be, a shinin' star
in fancy clothes, and fancy cars
and then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
(rihanna, let's get it)
so live your life (ayy!) ayyy ayyy ayyy
you steady chasin' that paper
just live your life (ohh!) ayyy ayyy ayyy
ain't got no time for no haters
just live your life (ayy!) ayyy ayyy ayyy
no tellin' where it'll take ya
just live your life (ohh!) ayyy ayyy ayyy

just livin' my life (ayy) my life (ohh)
my life (ayy) my life (ohh)
just livin' my life (ayy) my life (ohh)
my life (ayy) my life (ohh) just livin' my life
got everybody watchin' what i do, come walk in my shoes
and see the way i'm livin' if you really want to
got my mind on my money
and i'm not goin' awayyyyyyy
so keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
look in the mirror, and keep on shinin' (shinin')
until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
we gon' post up on the top spot
livin' the life, the life
in the windmill city got my whole team with me
the life, my life
i do it how i wanna do
i'm livin' my life, my life
i will never lose
i'm livin' my life, my life
and i'll never stop it

it beats for you, so listen close
hear my thoughts in every no—
oh—ote
make me your radio (yeah, ha)
and turn me up when you feel low (turn it up a little bit)
this melody was meant for you (right there)
to sing along to my stereo (gym class heroes, baby!)
if i was just another dusty record on the shelf
would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
if i asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
like yikky-yeah check it, travie, i can handle that
furthermore, i apologize for any skipping tracks
it's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
i used to, used to, used to, used to, now i'm over that
'cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts
if i could only find a note to make you understand
i'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
just keep me stuck inside your head like your favorite tune
and know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you (uh-ha-ha)

if i was an old-school, fifty-pound boombox (remember them?)
would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walk?
would you turn my volume up in front of the cops? (turn it up)
and crank it higher every time they told you to stop (peace)
and all i ask is that you don't get mad at me
when you have to purchase mad d batteries
appreciate every mixtape your friends make
you never know, we come and go like on the interstate (never know)
i think i finally found a note to make you understand
if you could hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
you know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you (uh-ha-ha)
my heart's a stereo (yeah)
it beats for you, so listen close (listen)

oh, oh oh-oh, oh (yeah)
oh oh-oh (to my stereo)
oh, oh-oh, oh
to sing along to my stereo (sing along, sing along)
i only pray you never leave me behind (never leave me)
because good music can be so hard to find (so hard to find)
i'll take your hand and hold it closer to mine (yeah)
thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind (yeah, yeah, come on, ooh)
my heart's a stereo (yeah)
it beats for you, so listen close

Bleeding Love,Leona Lewis,8533,"hey
closed off from love, i didn't need the pain
once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen, ooh
but somethin' happened for the very first time with you
my heart melted to the ground, found somethin' true
and everyone's lookin' 'round thinkin' i'm going crazy
ooh, yeah
but i don't care what they say, i'm in love with you
they try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
my heart's crippled by the vein that i keep on closin'
you cut me open and i
keep bleedin'
keep, keep bleeding love
i keep bleedin'
i keep, keep bleeding love
keep bleedin'
keep, keep bleeding love
you cut me open
mm, yeah
tryin' hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
their piercin' sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
yet i know that their goal is to keep me from fallin', ooh, yeah
but nothin's greater than the rush that comes with your embrace
and in this world of loneliness, i see your face
yet everyone around me thinks that i'm going crazy
maybe, maybe
but i don't care what they say, i'm in love with you
they try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
my heart's crippled by the vein that i keep on closin'
you cut me open and i
keep bleedin'
keep, keep bleeding love
i keep bleedin'
i keep, keep bleeding love
keep bleedin'
keep, keep bleeding love
you cut me open, mmh

i'll be wearin' these scars for everyone to see

Escape (The Pina Colada Song),Rupert Holmes,8474,"i was tired of my lady
we'd been together too long
like a worn out recording
of a favorite song
so while she lay there sleeping
i read the paper in bed
and in the personal columns
there was this letter i read
if you like piña coladas
and gettin' caught in the rain
if you're not into yoga
if you have half a brain
if you like making love at midnight
in the dunes on the cape
then i'm the love that you've looked for
write to me and escape
i didn't think about my lady
i know that sounds kind of mean
but me and my old lady
had fallen into the same old dull routine
so i wrote to the paper
took out a personal ad
and though i'm nobody's poet
i thought it wasn't half bad
yes, i like piña coladas
and gettin' caught in the rain
i'm not much into health food
i am into champagne
i've got to meet you by tomorrow noon
and cut through all this red tape
at a bar called o'malley's
where we'll plan our escape
so i waited with high hopes
and she walked in the place
i knew her smile in an instant
i knew the curve of her face
it was my own lovely lady
and she said, ""aw, it's you""
then we laughed for a moment
and i said, ""i never knew""
that you like piña coladas
and gettin' caught in the rain
and the feel of the ocean
and the taste of champagne
if you like making love at midnight
in the dunes on the cape
you're the lady i've looked for
come with me and escape
if you like piña coladas
and gettin' caught in the rain
if you're not into yoga
if you have half a brain
if you like making love at midnight
in the dunes on the cape
then i'm the love that you've looked for
write to me and escape
yes, i like piña coladas
and gettin' caught in the rain

not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
and you know, we're on each other's team
i'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
so there
so all the cups got broke
shards beneath our feet
but it wasn't my fault
and everyone's competing
for a love they won't receive
'cause what this palace wants is release

not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
and you know, we're on each other's team
i'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air

not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams

Make You Feel My Love,Adele,8467,"when the rain is blowing in your face
and the whole world is on your case
i could offer you a warm embrace
to make you feel my love
when the evening shadows and the stars appear
and there is no one there to dry your tears
i could hold you for a million years
to make you feel my love
i know you haven't made your mind up yet
but i will never do you wrong
i've known it from the moment that we met
no doubt in my mind where you belong
i'd go hungry, i'd go black and blue
i'd go crawling down the avenue
no, there's nothing that i wouldn't do
to make you feel my love
the storms are raging on the rollin' sea
and on the highway of regret
the winds of change are blowing wild and free
you ain't seen nothing like me yet
i could make you happy, make your dreams come true
nothing that i wouldn't do
go to the ends of the earth for you
to make you feel my love
to make you feel my love"

'cause every time i open up, it hurts
so i'm never gonna get too close to you
even when i mean the most to you
in case you go and leave me in the dirt
but every time you hurt me, the less that i cry

i'm never gonna let you close to me
even though you mean the most to me
'cause every time i open up, it hurts
so i'm never gonna get too close to you
even when i mean the most to you
in case you go and leave me in the dirt

kissed her on the neck and then i took her by the hand
said, ""baby, i just wanna dance""

she shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
she asked me what does it mean, the gaelic ink on your arm?
said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?
she took jamie as a chaser, jack for the fun
she got arthur on the table with johnny riding a shotgun
chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
then put van on the jukebox, got up to dance

kissed her on the neck and then i took her by the hand
said, ""baby, i just wanna dance""
with my pretty little galway girl
you're my pretty little galway girl
you know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
and then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
as last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
after dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
i never heard carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
a cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
oh, i could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
and in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me
you know, she played the fiddle in an irish band
but she fell in love with an english man
kissed her on the neck and then i took her by the hand
said, ""baby, i just wanna dance""

and now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
i was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
as we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
i walked her home then she took me inside
to finish some doritos and another bottle of wine
i swear i'm gonna put you in a song that i write
about a galway girl and a perfect night
she played the fiddle in an irish band
but she fell in love with an english man
kissed her on the neck and then i took her by the hand
said, ""baby, i just wanna dance""

Flowers In Your Hair,The Lumineers,8379,"when we were younger we thought
everyone was on our side
then we grew a little bit
and romanticized
the time i saw
flowers in your hair
see, it takes a boy to live
it takes a man to pretend he was there
so then we grew a little
and knew a lot
and how we demonstrated
it to the cops
and all the things we said
we were self-assured
'cause it's a long road to wisdom
but it's a short one to bein' ignored
be in my eyes
and be in my heart
be in my eyes, aye, aye, aye
and be in my heart
so now i think that i could
love you back
and i hope it's not too late
'cause you're so attractive
and the way you move
i won't close my eyes
'cause it takes a man to live
it takes a woman to make him compromise
so be in my eyes
be in my heart
be in my eyes, aye, aye, aye
and be in my heart"

my head is an animal
and once, there was an animal
it had a son that mowed the lawn
the son was an okay guy
they had a pet dragonfly
the dragonfly, it ran away
but it came back with a story to say
her dirty paws and furry coat
she ran down the forest slopes
the forest of talking trees
they used to sing about the birds and the bees
the bees had declared a war
the sky wasn't big enough for them all
the birds, they got help from below
from dirty paws and the creatures of snow
la-la-la, la-la-la-la
la-la-la, la-la-la-la
so for a while, things were cold
they were scared down in their holes
the forest that once was green
was colored black by those killing machines
but she and her furry friends
took down the queen bee and her men
and that's how the story goes
the story of the beast with those four dirty paws

tears on the mausoleum floor
blood stains the colosseum doors

thanksgiving disguised as a feast
rolling in the rolls-royce corniche
only the doctors got this, i'm hiding from police
cocaine seats
all white like i got the whole thing bleached
drug dealer chic

Where Is The Love?,The Black Eyed Peas,8222,"what's wrong with the world, mama?
people livin' like they ain't got no mamas
i think the whole world's addicted to the drama
only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
overseas, yeah, we tryna stop terrorism
but we still got terrorists here livin'
in the usa, the big cia
the bloods and the crips and the kkk
but if you only have love for your own race
then you only leave space to discriminate
and to discriminate only generates hate
and when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah
madness is what you demonstrate
and that's exactly how anger works and operates
man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
take control of your mind and meditate
let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all
people killin', people dyin'
children hurt, and you hear them cryin'
can you practice what you preach?
and would you turn the other cheek?
father, father, father, help us
send some guidance from above
'cause people got me, got me questioning
where is the love?
where is the love? (the love)
where is the love, the love, the love?
it just ain't the same, old ways have changed
new days are strange, is the world insane?
if love and peace is so strong
why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
nations droppin' bombs
chemical gases filling lungs of little ones
with ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
so ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
so i can ask myself, really, what is going wrong
with this world that we livin' in? people keep on givin' in
makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
a war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
the truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
if you never know truth, then you never know love
where's the love, y'all? come on (i don't know)
and where's the truth, y'all? come on (i don't know)
and where's the love y'all?
people killin', people dyin'
children hurt, and you hear them cryin'
can you practice what you preach?
and would you turn the other cheek?
father, father, father, help us
send some guidance from above
'cause people got me, got me questioning
where is the love?

where is the love?
where is the love? (the love)
where is the love, the love, the love?
i feel the weight of the world on my
shoulder
as i'm gettin' older, y'all people gets
colder
most of us only care about
money-makin'
selfishness got us followin' the
wrong direction
wrong information always shown by the
media
negative images is the main
criteria
infecting the young minds faster than
bacteria
kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity? (yeah)
whatever happened to the fairness and equality? (yeah)
instead of spreading love, we spreading animosity (yeah)
lack of understanding leading us away from unity
that's the reason why sometimes i'm feelin' under
that's the reason why sometimes i'm feelin' down
it's no wonder why sometimes i'm feelin' under
gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found

where is the love?

All Summer Long,Kid Rock,8215,"it was 1989, my thoughts were short, my hair was long
caught somewhere between a boy and man
she was seventeen and she was far from in-between
it was summertime in northern michigan
ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah
splashing through the sand bar
talking by the campfire
it's the simple things in life, like when and where
we didn't have no internet
but man, i never will forget
the way the moonlight shined upon her hair
and we were trying different things
we were smoking funny things
making love out by the lake to our favorite song
sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
singing ""sweet home alabama"" all summer long
singing ""sweet home alabama"" all summer long
catching walleye from the dock
watching the waves roll off the rocks
she'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
we'd blister in the sun
we couldn't wait for night to come
to hit that sand and play some rock and roll
while we were trying different things
we were smoking funny things
making love out by the lake to our favorite song
sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
singing ""sweet home alabama"" all summer long
singing ""sweet home alabama"" all summer long
""sweet home alabama,"" oh, yeah
turn it up!
now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
or how we thought those days would never end
sometimes i'll hear that song and i'll start to sing along
and think man, i'd love to see that girl again

my pops gave me some game in real person
retraced my steps on what they never taught me
did my homework fast before government caught me
so i'ma dedicate this one verse to oprah
on how the infamous, sensitive n-word control us
so many artists gave her an explanation to hole us
well, this is my explanation straight from ethiopia
n-e-g-u-s, definition: royalty, king royalty, wait, listen
n-e-g-u-s, description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish
the history books overlooked the word and hide it
america tried to make it to a house divided
the homies don't recognize we been usin' it wrong
so i'ma break it down and put my game in a song
n-e-g-u-s, say it with me, or say it no more
black stars can come and get me
take it from oprah winfrey, tell her she right on time

these are rhymes you can vision and feel
conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
we make it hype and you want to step
with this, shay plays on the fade
slice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade
so fast, other djs say, ""damn!""
if rhyme was a drug, i'd sell it by the gram
keep my composure when it's time to get loose
magnetized by the mic while i kick my juice
if there was a problem yo i'll solve it

I Don't Dance,Lee Brice,8020,"i'll never settle down

yes, you got me in the palm of your hand

and waltzed away with my heart

Your Body Is a Wonderland,John Mayer,8012,"we got the afternoon
you got this room for two
one thing i've left to do
discover me, discovering you
one mile to every inch of
your skin like porcelain
one pair of candy lips and
your bubblegum tongue
and if you want love we'll make it
swim in a deep sea of blankets
i take all your big plans and break 'em
this is bound to be a while
your body is a wonderland
your body is a wonder, i'll use my hands
your body is a wonderland
something 'bout the way
your hair falls in your face
i love the shape you take when
crawling towards the pillowcase
you tell me where to go
and though i might leave to find it
i'll never let your head hit the bed
without my hand behind it
you want love, we'll make it
swim in a deep sea of blankets
i take all your big plans and break 'em
this is bound to be a while
your body is a wonderland
your body is a wonder, i'll use my hands
your body is a wonderland
(i'll never speak again, again
i'll use my hands)
damn, baby
you frustrate me
i know you're mine all mine, all mine
but you look so good it hurts sometimes
your body is a wonderland (i'll never speak again, again)
your body is a wonder, i'll use my hands
your body is a wonderland (i'll never speak again, again)
your body is a wonderland (i'll use my hands)"

and her heart is breaking in front of me
and i have no choice
'cause i won't say goodbye anymore

woah, oh, oh
woah, oh, oh, oh

keep her coming every night
so hard to keep her satisfied, oh

pretending to feel the same
then turn around and leave again

even though i—
on my way, on my way, on my way down
on my way, on my way, on my way down
you were the one that was tryna keep me way down
but like the sun, know you know i find my way back round
they tell me i should fix my grill 'cause i got money now
i ain't gon' sit around and front like i ain't thought about it
a perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how
my shit is crooked—look at how far i done got without it!
i keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
we ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still
i got smart, i got rich and i got bitches still
and they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
love yourself, girl, or nobody will
though you a woman i don't know how you deal
with all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
i feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
you wake up, put makeup on
stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can't face what's wrong
no need to fix what god already put his paintbrush on
your roommate yelling, ""why you gotta take so long?!""
what it's like to have a crooked smile

to all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling
you wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
you keep falling victim 'cause you're insecure
and when i tell you that you're beautiful, you can't be sure
'cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin'
so all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin'
take it from a man that loves what you got
and baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
now is it real? eyebrows, fingernails, hair
is it real? if it's not, girl, you don't care
'cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see
that the hands can't touch, that them broads can't be
and that's you, never let 'em see your frown
and if you need a friend to pick you up, i'll be around
and we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
i can tell you ain't laughed in a while
but i wanna see that crooked smile

on my way, on my way, on my way down
you were the one that was tryna keep me way down
but like the sun, know you know i find my way back round
we got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
back round
, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
you were the one that was tryna keep me way down
but like the sun, know you know i find my way back round
we don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
you know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
but we got dreams and we got the right to chase 'em
look at the nation
that's a crooked smile braces couldn't even straighten
seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
wonder why we inhale, 'cause we in hell already
i ask: if my skin pale, would i then sell like eminem or adele?
but one more time for the 'ville
and fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let's make a mil'
hey officer man, we don't want nobody gettin' killed
just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail
i got money for the bail now, and well now
if you askin' will i tell now—ayy, hell nah
i ain't snitchin' 'cause, man, they get them niggas stitches now
if you was around then you wouldn't need a witness now
how you like this crooked smile?

Secrets,OneRepublic,7963,"i need another story
something to get off my chest
my life gets kinda boring
need something that i can confess
'til all my sleeves are stained red
from all the truth that i've said
come by it honestly i swear
thought you saw me wink, no
i've been on the brink, so
tell me what you want to hear
something that will light those ears

my god, amazing how we got this far
it's like we're chasing all those stars
who's driving shiny big black cars
and every day i see the news
all the problems that we could solve
and when a situation rises
just write it into an album
send it straight to gold
but i don't really like my flow, no

Teenagers,My Chemical Romance,7937,"they're gonna clean up your looks with all the lies in the books
to make a citizen out of you
because they sleep with a gun and keep an eye on you, son
so they can watch all the things you do
because the drugs never work, they're gonna give you a smirk
'cause they got methods of keeping you clean
they're gonna rip up your heads, your aspirations to shreds
another cog in the murder machine
they said, ""all teenagers scare the living shit out of me
they could care less as long as someone'll bleed""
so darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
the boys and girls in the clique, the awful names that they stick
you're never gonna fit in much, kid
but if you're troubled and hurt, what you got under your shirt
will make them pay for the things that they did
they said, ""all teenagers scare the living shit out of me
they could care less as long as someone'll bleed""
so darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me, oh, yeah
they said, ""all teenagers scare the living shit out of me
they could care less as long as someone'll bleed""
so darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me

drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
the best buzz i'm ever gonna find

and high on summertime
if you ain't a 10, you're a 9.9
tippin' n' spillin' that home-made wine
on your tied up t-shirt
every little kiss is drivin' me wild
throwin' little cherry bombs into my fire
good god almighty

dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon

When We Were Young,Adele,7924,"everybody loves the things you do
from the way you talk to the way you move
everybody here is watching you
'cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true
but, if by chance, you're here alone
can i have a moment before i go?
'cause i've been by myself all night long
hoping you're someone i used to know
you look like a movie, you sound like a song
my god, this reminds me of when we were young
let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time
that we might be exactly like we were before we realised
we were sad of getting old, it made us restless
it was just like a movie, it was just like a song
i was so scared to face my fears
nobody told me that you'd be here
and i swear you'd moved overseas
that's what you said when you left me
you still look like a movie, you still sound like a song
my god, this reminds me of when we were young
let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time
that we might be exactly like we were before we realised
we were sad of getting old, it made us restless
it was just like a movie, it was just like a song
(when we were young)
(when we were young)
(when we were young)
(when we were young)
it's hard to admit that (when we were young)
everything just takes me back (when we were young)
to when you were there (when we were young)
to when you were there
and a part of me keeps holding on (when we were young)
just in case it hasn't gone (when we were young)
i guess i still care (when we were young)
do you still care?
it was just like a movie, it was just like a song
my god, this reminds me of when we were young
(when we were young)
